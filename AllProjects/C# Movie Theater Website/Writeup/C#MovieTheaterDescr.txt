C# Movie Theater Project:

The goal of this project was to use C# and Visual Studio to create a website and 
backend database which would allow for the full functionality expected from a movie
theater's website. Primary functions included buying, gifting, and refunding tickets
as well as checking and spending rewards earned from purchases. Other functionality
included employees' ability to give tickets to customers, manage their own rewards, and
adjust movie schedules for the week. Additional functionality included managerial 
accounts which had all powers of employee accounts with additional responsibility of 
managing employee accounts and creating initial movie schedules.
