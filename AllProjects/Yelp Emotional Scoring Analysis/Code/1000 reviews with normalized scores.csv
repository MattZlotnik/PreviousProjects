With an unassuming street faÃ§ade, it's demure to passers-by, but hard to leave once you're on the warm inside.

The chefs daughter is celiac, so they were very knowledable about gluten-free options. In fact, instead of bread and oil, we were served a chickpea- flour bread baked with rosemary--it was melt-in-your-mouth, and multiples better than the polenta it resembled.

Service was very articulate beyond just wheat-free suggestions. We tasted and learned about Gattinara wines, from vineyards in the Northwest of Italy, from the very owner! 

The server and owner both took time to sit with us at the table--they were brimming with hospitality and yet exuded authority with their suggestions. Our plates were served gracefully, deftly.

The meal:

We were offered a choice between a special tasting menu, a $25 prix fixe (salad, pasta & desert) and the full menu. I chose a la carte.

Along with the chick-pea cakes, the olives were the best I've ever had--spicy, sweet, black and wrinkly. I didn't even know that olives could even be improved upon!

 The Amore Negro wine was incredible--the bouquet, the smoothness--as was the Sangiovese.

I had trouble resisting the octopus salad, but settled on the white asparagus with hollandaise and white polenta! It was divine!!

My entrÃ©e was the branzino stuffed with rosemary and bay, served with olive oil that the fluffy meat just absorbs like magic, accompanied by stuffed artichokes and chard.

For desert, I split flourless chocolate cake with ricotta tart with a friend, but I must return for the meringue!

I can't believe how many times I walked past Zucca, perfectly situated just South of Y& Eg. All it took was a friend to make the recommendation--now we're hooked!",307

While we were browsing the store a young man who worked for the store began to pass by the end of each aisle we were in, and sometimes just stand at the end of the aisle looking back and forth at nothing not asking us if we needed help. It was getting to be pretty ridiculous seeing that there was a huge boxed aquarium in our cart and it would be ridiculous for him to think we would steal a bulky object as that! He would just end up at the end of every aisle we were browsing which got me pretty upset to have a shopping experience as that. I should have just left the cart in the store without purchasing anything, but we ended up buying a tank, a large bag of fish gravel, aquarium salt, and a few decorations. There was absolutely no reason to have suspicion about us, and he was not looking to help us because he never asked if we needed help.

It's a really small restaurant that does have some seating area but it feels extremely cramped if you stay there. The kitchen is also out in the open so you can see the chefs tossing their woks flames and all as well as smell the food as you sit for your meal. Most people come in, give their order and when it's ready - usually 15-20 mins- take it to go.

They have a variety of options ranging from Chinese/Cantonese, Vietnamese and Thai dishes along with your western classics like eggrolls and general tao.
If you're familiar with asian cuisine and would like a different noodle type or sauce that's not listed, they can probably cook it up just the way you want it.
My Asian mom would often come in and chat up with the cooks and get a special dish that isn't listed on the menu.

Prices have increased a little in the almost 10 years that I've been going there, but it remains cheap.
Just to give you an idea, my favorite dish, the ""Yang Chow"" fried rice used to be around 6 $ back in 2003, and every year it seems to increase by a dollar. 
Portions are very big. This is the kind of restaurant where it is best to order  at least 2 or 3 plates and share.

As per many asian or small businesses I noticed, this place accepts cash only.",270

The quality of the food was okay but sitting in the back with bathroom tiled decor eating our $30 meal did not feel worthy of the price. It didn't feel ""clean"" as another reviewer said and the bright lights just showcase every imperfection of the place.

My review is also slightly biased because I'm generally never craving soup. Not that I don't love a good soup but there is never a day where I say to myself, ""I really need a soup right now."" It's generally...""I need a poutine or I need some Asian food."" Soup...not really. So perhaps that is why I felt as though the price (min $10) for the soups are a little high. I also like paying for ""effort"" and when someone makes soup in bulk, pouring it into a bowl for me doesn't seem like much ""effort"". 

Now if you are a soup lover then this might be the place for you.

3 stars for an average experience due to the decor and the high cost of the simple meal.",226

The place was a ghost town. out at the stores near the lake it always smells terrible. As if sewage has leaked out onto the walkway. The televisions are terrible. In the den they still had an old crt television... The worst part is that the channels are mirrored in every room. everyone watches the same thing at the same time and there is no way around it. i actually had to run the telephone wire behind the couch to the outlet myself in order to call the front desk! The phone wasn't even plugged in... Staff could care less about your issues. The restaurants and shops seemed to be open only on the weekend and for only a few hours at that. pointless to stay here in my opinion.,135

Just as Pizzeria Bianco did not disappoint, neither did IR.  

The bread (crostini) brought out was delectable.  I literally savored every bite.  I wish I could've eaten a small plate's worth.  The cheese plate is a winning appetizer.  Various types of cheeses, marmalade (little too sweet for my liking, but definitely homemade) to pair with a glass of wine perhaps.

I had the dish with short ribs.  Whew, some of the best, most tender I've ever had!  While I couldn't finish all of my risotto, I made sure not to leave one bite of meat!  Quite flavorful, even if the texture of the risotto was not my favorite.  I also tasted the fettuccine, which the next table over was raving about.  Definitely different with the lemon and not something I would think I would enjoy, but alas I was wrong.  
The dining room through the main room is simple yet charming with its mixed and matched chairs and asymmetrically placed light fixtures.

Service was top notch.",203

Against she had no footstool. She continue to say things like I didn't give her a chance . I mean anybody who call four times in a row and all I did is just not answer it I planned to just give her a call and we'll talk about it I mean I'm in pain I'm in agony and I'm having a good day with my kid  she is emotionally unstable  telling me I'm difficult how was I being difficult she was the one calling me non-stop I have the proof on my phone and then the texts and the the name-calling and my text basically said please just stop I think I said stop at least 3 to 4 times but txtss kept coming in and if this is a professional person I would rather go any place else!

Hubs ordered the broccolini to start, chicken and gnocchi for a main and the chocolate torte for dessert. The arancini was delicious, the sauce it was plated on was fresh and the acidity in the arugula cut through the richness of the dish, so delicious! Hubs said he really enjoyed the brocollini and how it all came together. The main was really good, the chicken was cooked perfectly, the gnocchi were a good texture but a little bit bland, overall it was still a tasty main. Dessert was delicious, the carrot cake was the perfect amount of sweet with the cream cheese topping, the chocolate torte was very rich, I sampled a bit of it and although hubs didn't finish it, he did say it was very satisfying.

The furnishings and equipment definitely look like they are from the 90's, and the polish selection is pretty small.  But, they do a pretty good pedicure. 

They had exactly the orangish red color I was looking for, so that was a plus. The massage chair was comfortable. The nail tech was polite and didn't chit chat, which I appreciate, but still smiled and was generally friendly. She did a particularly nice leg and foot rub, and the leg scrub smelled exactly like a green apple Jolly Rancher, which is a plus in my book.

I stupidly wore a maxi dress and smudged my big toe on my way to the dryer. She was very nice about fixing it, and ended up redoing the whole toe as she first selected the wrong polish color. The pedicure looks very good, and the price ($25) is what I remember pedicures costing before they started edging up towards $30 at many salons.",170

Years ago, there was a mexican restaurant (was very dark inside- I liked it, but hubby didn't, but it's been closed for a few years now. Only a few vacant spaces for lease. Good amount of parking, unless it's super busy at Trader Joe's (avoid on the 1st/15th). 

Situated on the left- side corner of the shopping center (from Decatur),  loved and very popular Trader Joe's (one of the busiest locations)- we pretty much go here on a weekly basis. Senior shuttles come in the late afternoon on weekdays (2 pm- 3 pm). Other customers frequent this store right after work or after the gym. Best time for us to shop: sunday morning- has the smallest crowd.

Situated kitty-corner from Trader Joe's, is Dotty's Bar- seems to be a popular place, and situated in many strip centers, all throughout the city.

Mochicko Chicken- new place I wanna try; featuring chicken fingers and chicken bowls, most under $9.99- sauces (50 cents), drinks (two sizes) and sides (tender, grilled chicken, fried egg, rice, fries, asian slaw, stiry fry veggies, hawaiian sweet roll).

Amena Bakery- middle-eastern?

Amber Unicorn Books-  a used book store (seems like there are just a few of these around now)

Fabric Store- looks like a specialty fabric store, especially for quilting 

Medical Supply

Beauty Salon- Cynthia's

Nails (another beauty salon)

Situated on the other corner (facing Decatur), US Bank- we stop by the drive-thru ATM sometimes; I think that the branch office hours are weekdays only.",269

I was waiting for a ride in Port Credit and I thought I'd grab a quick bite to eat at Gino's Pizza. This experience was a total nightmare, it just kept getting worse and worse.
I saw a sign for 2 slices for $5 and went inside. It looked kind of scuzzy but they served pizza and beer, two staples in my diet.
I ordered a slice of Pepperoni and a slice with pepperoni, mushrooms, and green peppers. I took a bite of the pepperoni and it tasted like cardboard. Completely tasteless, so I decided to eat the other one. It was bland but that's not the worst part. When I looked at the slice of pepperoni, there was a FLY IN IT. I was disgusted. I spent forever trying to get the attention of the staff (they were in the back talking, I was SCREAMING ""excuse me"", but they didn't seem to hear me). When he finally came over I let him know and he apologized and gave me another slice. Umm okay. That's disgusting. I sat back down and looked at the wall and there were dead flies all around the sign inside. Oh God. I didn't eat my second slice.
I went to the bathroom which was decrepit at best. It was horrifyingly dirty, like everything else in this place. I refused to use it. I just left. To top it all off, when I went outside and around the corner (where my ride was waiting to get me) the neon sign was CAKED IN FLIES. Bleh! So unhygienic. This place cannot be up to code. It was absolutely horrendous. I spent rest of the night nursing my aching stomach.
Will never return.",290

another cool nook in this store is devoted to local music, just coffee, and peruvian belts and blouses.  it's always nice to promote local.

I got a great Clinique gift set for my cousin, which included a lotion, make-up removal, lippy, mascara, eyeshadow set and body wash for only $35.

We were staying at the Cosmo and the line was so long every time we walked by, that we ended up getting up early both days so we could be in line around 7am. It's a pretty inexpensive breakfast for eating on the strip and we were able to try both the sausage breakfast sandwich and the Fairfax + sausage. We also got a biscuit one day to share and we both really enjoyed that with the maple syrup.

My only complaint is that they use turkey sausage, great health wise but it always seemed to be a little dry. Also my husband wasn't a huge fan of the coffee, he said the roast was darker than he liked. We both loved the orange juice, and while $5 for 12 ounces of orange juice seems a little on the high side, I only wished they sold it in a larger cup!!",169

Really cute and busy inside, but there was hardly a wait. They serve bread with three type of dip (free!), hummous, a really delish tomato-y eggplant dip and a garlicy mayo dip. 

I ordered a portobello mushroom burger (all veggies...grilled veg with fried onions!) and it came with this amazing garlicy sauce. And fries with salad! Can you imagine? If you went to Earls, or Milestones or one of these other places, they'd force you to pay an extra amount for fries and salad together. But this place ... both come with your meal!

My parents shared a ""fish and chips"".... a grilled snapper, the full sucker on a hot iron plate and subbed yam fries (an extra $1.25) and my fiance ordered an avocado chicken sandwich with Hooegarden (sp?).

My burger was AMAZING. I will be back here again for the burger. It was all veggie, but tasted like it was one of those delicious bad-for-you burgers. And OMFG - the yam fries. Thin but sweet and freshly fried and served with the chipotle mayo.

You can see all the fancy glitzy shows with their LED Vide Walls and moving lights, but if you want to see the roots of what made and still makes live performance great, Mac King is a genius. He takes the beauty and essence of vaudeville style magic and comedy and makes it as alive and thriving as ever. If you are going to go to all the other insipid shows in Vegas, please do, but see Mac first. 

Then ask yourself honestly what all those other big over the top production shows are missing? If you are too slow to get the answer, you'll never get it so never mind. Just give Mac King your money first anyway. If you are honest, the answer is that Mac's routine respects the audience. Not only because he keeps it PG, but because he respects our intelligence. He will throw in zingers and puns that are funny on one level, but go over many folks' heads in a larger sense. I am reminded of Groucho Marx's wit when I hear Mac do this and Harpo and Chico Marx's comedic timing on the former more physical and base level humor. Nonetheless, Mac keeps those quick zingers in there and does not cheapen his routine just because everyone in the crowd does not get it. He respects us.

I went mid March 2011. I was in Vegas with my best friend and our moms and we wanted a spa experience while in Vegas but didn't want to pay ridiculous amounts of $$$.  We did a little searching and decided to try this place.

Great decision.  At first, i was hesitant because we went on our last day and so we had already dropped a bunch of money in Vegas, but once i got there and was enjoying a fantastic foot massage during my pedi it was worth every penny!

I got a french pedicure and a facial.  usually after a facial I leave looking all red and such but when I left my face looked amazing, clear skin, balanced and smooth and not a bit red!  I was very impressed.

My total was $160 for a pedi and facial and i tipped $20 so overall reasonably priced for the region.  I would definitely go back if I'm ever in Vegas again.",174

This place reminds me of what I used to do when I was married. Get shitty at neighborhood bar  and eat unhealthy food.   What is wrong with that? Nothing! I had not been here in years, and to think it is so close. I remember   how smokey this place was, I would get sick from it.  This is not where your uber hip international posse hangs out, BTW : ) Although there would not be a problem with that from what I surmise.

This was a fun place.  Definitely, a metal head type of place to get shit faced and feed money into Keeno(which I played for the 1st time) and grub some bar food.  My friends ordered some chicken fingers.  They were good.  The dipping sauces tasted homemade for the most part.  The extra spicy one was fantastic. If I had to bet, this place probably has some amazing chicken wings! Thanks M&M for inviting me!

I think next time I will play some Madonna just to see what happens. The music being played was mostly old skoool metal and rap.  

I could also see this being a place for drinking by ones self!  So if you want an unpretentious  neighborhood watering hole  without too many douchebags this would be your place. Not a place for high maintenance type of folks!",253

I once paid for a poutine which is 6 dollars, i paid them 20 dollars and they give me 8 dollars back, like can you guys do simple math? 
They take so long to make the food and their service is horrible. 

ALSO they don't even have garbage cans to throw stuff out. And their washroom look like it was not renovated.
Lastly they keep bribing us to come back for business. An example of that would be like ""one dollar milkshakes this Friday, come and we will give you"". 
They also keep asking us why aren't the kids from school coming to their restaurant anymore because everyone does not come here anymore
Also there is dirty stuff all over the forks, cups, tissues and etc. 
No air conditioning and plus the doors always open so bugs keep coming in. And they increase their price because know one wants to come because their unsanitary.
They touch money with their dirty hands and their attitude is not welcoming.

Plus on their website (oldevillagebistro.com/about-us.php) they say that ""oldevillage bistro has been in business for over 20 years which i respect however it is not true that ""we prepare our food with care each time."" Also they say that 96% of our customers are returning customers.",259

I guess they are a franchise but they're so small and unknown that they feel more like a small business that offers that personalized touch you won't find at Starbucks. Its nice inside and has a few comfy couches. This is an excellent place to study because it just gives off such a supportive vibe. They've even got some back rooms that can be reserved for various meetings. Note that if I see you talking loudly in the back rooms while I'm trying to study I just might slap you in the face. You can reserve them for ten dollars, which goes onto your saxby card if you have one, and can be immediately spent on coffee and snack items. It's more of a way of ensuring that room denizens buy coffee from the shop instead of just free loading on the space. Wifi is free for paying customers only, and I don't have a problem with that.

I've tried their french roast as well as their bold. Both are excellent, full bodied coffees, and at 2 dollars for a medium you can't go wrong.  Ive yet to  try any of their iced drinks but you had best believe that I'll be having some in the very near future.

No stranger to kombucha, Dan was happy to answer all of my questions and make some beverage recommendations. Right now they're serving two types of kombucha on tap - orange and lemon lavender. Both are a little sweet for my taste - which I have never experienced before. 

My partner and I both ordered the lemon lavender kombucha with juiced lemon and cayenne - delicious, the right level of tartness that you would expect with plain / lightly infused kombucha. 

If you're in the area and want something to take away - this is a great spot. They also offer growlers! However, there are some higher quality, small batch kombucha companies in the city that are brewing better booch that don't need the added juices for balance.",167

Yes, Cher....all 63 years of her and not an ounce of fat on her. If she could back ti-yummm...ti-yummmmm. Anyway, amid the drunken youngsters drinking the bong-shaped decanters of margaritas, we suddenly heard the ghostly voice of Celine Dion screeching to us that her heart will go on. My God, isn't she back in Montreal yet? I avoided Vegas for six years so I wouldn't have to hear that pompous voice of hers. 

Alas, it was the sound system at the Fountains of Bellagio playing her overplayed song as the waters danced to the bombast. Gratefully, it was the very end we had to hear, so we waited patiently for the next show in fifteen minutes. This time, it was Lee Greenwood singing his tribute to Reaganomics - ""God Bless the USA"" - and you can see how those policies have brought us today to near financial ruin. Regardless, the fountains are quite a sight, especially at night with all the lights adding yet another dimension.

Apparently, there are three types of nozzles used to make the special effects - oarsmen (jets with a full range of spherical motion); shooters (which shoot water upwards); and super shooters (which send the water up as high as 250 feet in the air). Gee, that sounds like one of the sex shows that those guys are selling with those cards that they pluck and snap as you pass by. The whole extravaganza lasts about three to four minutes, and no worry if you miss one as another show comes in fifteen to thirty minutes depending on the time of day. It's quite a dazzler, and your only other free option is watching the Sirens of T.I. (Treasure Island). I am so not in that target audience.

Oh yeah, here's my video of that waterworks show...http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8ehU_hPD5E",322

So, I was so glad that on our last night (after the Machida fight!), we got to go here.  And it was just as good as I remembered...

Crawfish, crab legs (both cold and warm... and they're different styles ex. tossed in an asian sauce), fish galore (ones in a chunky tomato sauce, shrimp tempura, mediterranian style, etc.  I will say, some had a fishy taste to it so after a while I just stuck to eating my ginormous plate of crab legs), hush puppies, sushi, seafood soup (2 types, a cajun style and another one I forget), you can make tacos, eat stir fried noodles with chicken and shrimp, they of course have shrimp cocktail, and mussels, clams, and oysters.  All I know is, this is my dream buffet, and I hate that they don't have one of this kind in Hawaii.  Yes we have todai, and makino chaya... but that's more of an Asian buffet (plus the crab legs, sashimi, etc.), but this is the epitome of buffets, and, may I add, well worth the $42 per person.

We have visited Da Valley Grill three times now, and we have enjoyed each time. The location is a little hard to find. If you weren't looking for it, you would never know it existed as it's located in an industrial-looking business center. We drove past it the first time we went. 

On our first visit, the hubby ordered my all-time favorite plate lunch, Chicken Katsu. It was lightly pan-fried and was nice and crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside. The accompanying sauce was a little different that I have been used to, as it's a little on the sweeter side. I'm used to a more smoky favor, but it was still tasty. So we could try another item on the menu, I ordered the Kalua Pig. It was flavorful, tender, juicy, and not too salty. The plates are served with two scoops of rice and one side (macaroni salad, potato salad, or coleslaw). On the second visit, the hubby again went with the Chicken Katsu, while I ordered their Kahuku Shrimp (mostly because my dad is a Kahuku High School alum, lol). The shrimp tasted fresh and the sauce had a nice, spicy kick to it. On our most recent visit, I couldn't pass up the Chicken Katsu yet again, so we both ordered it this time. 

While the restaurant is small, it is clean and has plenty of seating. Service has been friendly and consistent. I wish their saimin was served all day, rather than just during breakfast (7-10am weekdays, none on Saturday) as it is one of the foods I miss most from the islands.",287

I've been eating a lot of tacos lately and I think that I'm probably ... ya ... definitely I'm addicted to tacos now. Hello, my name is Taco. I like tacos. I eat tacos because of the taste in my taco that happens tacos I put the tacos inside of me and my tacos tacos tacos tacos forever. 

These tacos are the real deal (Evander) Holyfield. Gigantesco is the Spanish word for gigantic and that is just what comes to mind when describing these tacos. This is one big and beautiful taco. Her juices cascade down my mouth to my beard; she gets everywhere. All over my face and hands. Coriander is cilantro and the air is heavy with it; that heady green aroma envelops my frijoles. That means beans and beans ain't fuckin' around. The smoke and heat of sultry chipotle invites your tastebuds to stay for a while. Take a dip because the water is just fine. Tacos Tijuana promises a lot ... and it delivers. This is a very East L.A. sort of a place. They've got piÃ±atas for sale as well as Jaritos soda. Go here with Rebecca and feast on tacos ... whilst the two young lovers gazed knowingly into each other (dipping one mind into the mind of the other ... two solitudes sharing space and time and mind in a vast abyss) ... they carelessly share an authentic one half litre glass bottle of Mexican Coca~Cola made with real sugar instead of high-fructose corn syrup. And that's a good thing, opined the felon Martha Stewart. Two giant tacos for eight dollars and you'll eat like Juan Carlos Alfonso VÃ­ctor MarÃ­a de BorbÃ³n y BorbÃ³n-Dos Sicilias for a week. Anyway, Mexico got independence from Spain a long time ago so ... that doesn't really work but whatever. Just go eat tacos and maybe I'll see you then.

I ditched my 8th Grade promotion and came here with my dad on Thursday.We came in and we're seated within 10 seconds by a young girl no older than 10 (who we assumed to be the owners daughter) and our drink orders were taken right away. As soon as they returned with our drinks they took our main order. We had no idea what the menu said since a lot was in Italian, with some quick clarification from our amazing server, we settled on the Italian Stalion Pizza and the Chicken Pesto Lasagna (which we split both of.)They came out with lasagna first. It was delicious! It came served on a large platter, with a creamy pesto sauce lathered all over, we dipped many of our bites in the sauce on the plate. It was easily the best lasagna I've ever had! A must try. Then came the Italion Stalion, Rocky Balboa...jk. We saw the  pizza being put in to the the wood fired oven and was completely done in 2 minutes. It was an authentic thin crust pizza with a,nase of their own house - made tomato sauce and a small amount of there own creamy house made mozzarela, (the less cheese the better in my opinion. With American pizzas they pack on so much cheese you can barely taste the toppings. La Piazza found a perfect median. Enough cheese to easily taste and get satisfaction, but not overwelming) and then topped with a generous portion of 4 or 5 incredible italian meats. You could tell the meat was incredibly fresh as it was moist and packed with flavor. The best pizza I've ever had. We finished with a normal and chocolate can oil which sadly was only ok. I'd had much better. Next time we will go for the cheesecake. Overall it was hands down the best Italian you will find anywhere in Arizona! This is my new favorite restauaunt. It was relatively cheap as well! After the pizza, lasagna, canolies, and a 20% tip, we paid just under $40. We will definetly be back!",353

What I thought would be a long day and full of frustration ended up with my daughter finding her perfect dress within the first three dresses pulled. Alice did a great job listening to my daughter and helped her find a beautiful gown. My daughter left with such a big smile on her face and a big relief of knowing that the biggest decision was accomplished.

I visited the location on Las Vegas Boulevard, adjacent to the Monte Carlo Resort. (I understand that there is another separate location at the SLS Hotel & Casino.)

So let's start with the positives:

It has a great location facing the Las Vegas Strip. It has indoor and outdoor seating. The interior is well decorated. And I feel that the pricing is very reasonable, when you consider the other eating options on The Strip. Also note that one of the features of this chain is that you can ""customize"" you own pizza.

But with regards to the food.... Personally I can only give ""an average"" rating based on my one meal.  I ordered the sausage with caramelized onions, and did not ask for any special customization. I wanted to see what their interpretation was. The pizza was beautiful to look at. But I prefer a dryer, crispier crust. The rim of my pizza's crust was crispy--but the bottom (flat area) of the crust was ""wet"". 

Maybe this is what a traditional Neapolitan pizza is supposed to be like, and I am used to ""American style"" pizza (?). The European tourist seemed to enjoy their meals.",209

We were given a suite on the top floor....a very swanky one that included the previously mentioned, awesome, see-through full length window panel from the shower to the bed (both of our boyfriends were incredibly jealous when they heard about this...hehe).  

Kinky showers aside, this place has it all...amazingly plush robes, a view of the CN tower, very attentive concierge and absolutely phenomenal ""continental"" breakfast. It is in quotations because it is a far cry from the pre-mixed eggs and pasty bagels that come to mind when this breakfast style is mentioned. 

Hence - the rest of this review will discuss the breakfast....

- all the fresh cut strawberries you can eat
- a hostess that greats you with cappuccino (made with soy milk if you wish!)
- smoked salmon, with capers and lemon wedges
- delicious cheeses
- various fresh breads and croissants
- spiced oatmeal with amazing berry compote
- and of course eggs (but not the kind that shape to your spoon when you dish them out)

... it's like I stepped into a European gourmet cafe... but one that did not judge me when I went back for 2nds (uhm... maybe 3rds)

ADVICE:
If you're considering staying at one of the chains, because it'll be $50 or so cheaper... skip that, come here and enjoy the best ""continental"" breakfast you could ever dream up... and of course, ask for the see-through shower suite. Just for kicks.",282

This gym isn't a bad gym, but isn't a great gym either. Couple good things about this gym is 24/7 tap gym. Decent size place and offers some xtr equipment. Plenty of treadmills and some are quite high end. Good price and tap card works at any snap fitness. 

Some bad things about this gym is that it's limited in equipment and machinery.  Limited in weights/plates and bars. Very few locations available and if some are close to you awesome! 

I would have to say it's hard to workout here unless you know what times to go where there aren't too many people working out. This can be good for you or bad depending if you workout or not. Pros as you can use whatever you want whenever. Cons being if you are new it can be hard to just up and start working out without some guidance and usually people are nice enough to tell you if it's harmful for you.",180

As for the food...meh. I had a $64 bone-in rib eye which was just ok. I've had $17 steaks better. The blue cheese butter was gross. The $9 mashed potatos were without a doubt more bland and dull tasting than instant box potatos. $20 for a peach vodka drink. Bread was mediocre.

So, we have a classic case of building perceived value through fancy menus, atmosphere and dressed up staff. The quality of food doesn't justify the price though. I wont be back.",124

If not for her recommendation, I might have missed this place - so thanks K, cause Marigold is delicious. 

Had no problems finding a table for 4 on a Wednesday night, and the staff was incredibly helpful in describing menu items.  Granted with the responsibility to order plates for the entire table (heavy is the crown...), I was going to add king prawn xacutti to the list of dishes I had already chosen.  The gentleman suggested that since the xacutti is very similar in taste to the seafood curry, that he might be able to ask the kitchen to do a prawn masala instead to switch up the taste. 

It ended up being our favourite dish of the night.  The prawns were really big; much bigger than those ""jumbo"" shrimp you get at other places sometimes.  Full of flavour, succulent shrimp, creamy consistency...yum, I totally want some right now.  I love butter chicken, but this one easily trumped it that night. 

Actually, the butter chicken is what originally brought me here as my friend said it's the most delicious she's ever had.  I think it's made up of chunks of chicken breasts, in a reddish brown butter chicken sauce that's a little less on the creamy side and heavier on the spices and chicken flavour.  

Other hits with us that night were the garlic naan and the free round of pre-dinner pappadums. 

The naan is the size of a small plate, so if you opt to forego rice, order at least one naan per person.  You might find yourself wanting even more to devour every last tasty drop!",304

The staff seemed disinterested and chided us for making a reservation. Apparently we only needed one if we were ordering hibachi (we weren't).

The sushi fit our craving, but it was just mediocre. The seaweed salad was unusually sweet and the sushi was at least room temperature. I usually enjoy sushi that is a little on the colder side.

Let's place this review amongst the Las Vegas environment - things are just more expensive. If you want to come to Las Vegas to eat affordably, I would suggest avoiding this place. It's run by two world class chefs. The add for the mimosas is well worth it, considering places on the strip offer a similar add on for $15. The day I went, they had 9 different flavours (one of which was watermelon rosemary, another was prickly pear, pretty unique).

Our server was Luis, and he was wonderful. I can't give him anymore credit. He was quick to describe the dishes and make suggestions. He kept bringing us new flavours of mimosas without us even asking.

We tried about 90% of the menu items, at least once. The food was incredibly fresh and flavourable. It had a great authenticity to the flavours. You could tell the chefs really care about this cuisine. When we sat down, we received a starter of empanandas to start as our server said it'll be a little bit before we received our first round, which was not only thoughtful but they were tasty as heck!

I suspect many are giving heavy handed reviews as this is a ""sentimental"" favorite.  I guess even my rating is slightly biased that way too.  But 5 stars people?  Meaning it cannot get any better than ""woohoo, as good as it gets""?  Ok, I'll end my rant and get to the review.

In short, this is your typical old school Mandarin/Szechuan style chinese restaurant.  Decor is slightly tired, but who really cares about decor anyways for a neighborhood chinese restaurant?

Staff couldn't have been friendlier.  It's family run (from what I gather) and take out service is quick and efficient.  They include almond cookies, sauces, utensils, and fortune cookies in a nice packet with your to go order.  Everything was packaged VERY well.

The menu is a diverse variety of your typical chinese items.  Be aware that some dishes (like the Moo Goo Gai Pan) have alternate names (like ""Snow White Chicken"").

Still with me?  Good...on to the food.

I ordered BBQ pork slices, Kung Pao Chicken, and a dish they called ""Bo Bo Shrimp"".  

The BBQ pork slices were generally not too fatty as they can be other places, however some pieces were sliced too thin as they were dry.  Also, the seasoning did not permeate the meat that much.  There was also no ""sauce"" (which is good, because Char Siu should not have any sauce per se).  Maybe I'm just spoiled with good BBQ pork, and I also realize it's just an appetizer, but could have been better and more flavorful.

The Kung Pao Chicken is very average.  First I'm appreciative of chinese restaurants that use dark meat instead of white as it's not dry.  But add to that a lot of peanuts that were a little overpowering (I felt like an elephant), lots of cubed green pepper and onion, and a lot of sauce made this the typical Kung Pao chicken.  Was it bad?  It wasn't bad, but not 5 stars great either.  I don't know if I really understand why Phoenix area chinese places are compelled to throw a ton of vegetables in Kung Pao.  It'd be nice for once to have a relatively vegetable-less ""meat"" dish and order vegetables separately (like how you order at better chinese places).  Compared to other places in Phoenix, it was probably better than what I've had, but again, not 5 stars ""amazing"".

The Bo Bo shrimp was a breaded shrimp dish with a spicy brown sauce.  On the positive, I tasted the ginger and garlic come out of the sauce, but the breading on the shrimp was so heavy it was falling off as I ate it.  Perhaps it was because it was take out and it got soggy, so I'll reserve some judgement for when I dine in person, but I've had plenty of take out and the shrimp are not always like that.  I would have preferred a lighter coating which can be achieved with a dusting of cornstarch.

I can see why this place has gotten the accolades because relatively speaking, there isn't a lot of good accessible chinese food here in Phoenix (well, unless you go to Cofco Plaza, Lee Lee Market, Great Wall, etc.).  But again, there is much better around.

With that being said, if you've read my other reviews you'll see I am a big fan of locally run non-chain restaurants.  So don't let my review scare you too much, I'm just picky and have high expectations.  I certainly could have ordered items that are difficult to make poorly (Mushu pork, mongolian beef, etc.) but chose Kung Pao as it's difficult to pull off properly.  So please try this place for yourself and form your own opinion.  At least you have mine.",673

We have 3 dogs and my elderly father living here, AC is a must.  I started calling companies at 1:30 am that claimed to have 24 hour emergency service.  None of the big companies had availability before 8 am.  I found MD Air Heating and Cooling on YELP with great reviews and took the chance.  It was just about 2 am and to my surprise and delight a real person answered the phone and that real person was the owner of the company. I explained my issue after apologizing for calling in the middle of the night and he graciously agreed to be here by 7 am.  They arrived at 6:30 am, identified the problem in less than 5 minutes and replaced the bad part.  All-in-all they were only here for maybe 30 mins.

2) I ordered medium rare steak diane and instead I got medium well. 
3) I complained to the server and the serve informed me that I had to pay the regular price for a new side of steak! WTF?!
4) Server understood I shouldn't have to pay and asked what else he can do. So I asked for 2 free cheesecakes. He said he'll talk to his manager.
5) Server said they can make me a new side of steak to still try it out. I agreed
6) Good steak diane. Not sweet like my mom's steak and cooked well

I was really craving breakfest food but found that most of their eggs/hashbrown etc... were either overcooked or just simply not tasty.  They had some nice shrimp cocktail here but it was sitting in this enclosed little area in the middle or nowhere...The crab legs were also very small and unpelled and required WAY to much work to be even worth it.  Their sushi, like most other vegas buffets, really didn't taste all that fresh or good either.  The only thing I enjoyed at this buffet was their prime rib, which was somewhat decent.  I also liked the fresh made omeletts too.  For $20.50, I would definetly skip this buffet and venture off to planet hollywood, belliago, wynn, or paris, as for a few bucks more you'll really see a big difference in food and quality.  I will someday try their dinner buffet and report back.

I will try the dinner buffet and see how it o",186

Their American bbq section...the tri-tip= not so great, okay mac&cheese, weak greens and decent yams. 

Yummy salad bar, but they prepare it for you. 

And the dessert bar? My favorite part of the meal. They had a great selection of mini desserts. The creme brulee, fruit tart, chocolate covered strawberries and banana donuts were all yummy.

Although some of my food didn't taste that great- it wasn't horrible, I was fine there leaving with a full stomach. But not even a couple hours laters, my tummy started hurting and I was hoping it'd go away as we had got to our seats for the Love show. Sadly, my stomach got worse and I had no other choice than to go poop in a public bathroom. I NEVER go #2 in a public bano! That's just not cool. But my stomach was killing me and thankfully, I was able to relieve myself with plenty of time before the show started.

This is a great restaurant for Tex-Mex food. The chips and salsa are addicting. The chips have the perfect amount of salt. The menu has a lot to choose from. The margaritas are good and the service ranges from okay to good depending on the crowd.

The food isn't the best Mexican food I've ever had, but it's good, it's always good, everything on the menu is good. It's consistent, it's fresh, and the portions are more than you'll need. Chicken burrito is a bit dry but works with salsa. Shrimp tacos are very good, with a decent amount of shrimp. Steak quesadilla is very cheesy (white cheese) and the tortilla has the perfect slight crispness. Food is also quickly prepared.",145

I have been visiting Lori at The Sweet Life for years, and a few years ago she joined up with 2 Gals and serves her bakery items here.  (Best bakery in this area hands down!!!). So teaming up with this restaurant was a killer idea, and everyone can get some amazing desserts after their meal!

I visited with a friend and my 1.5 year old son.  Not much for kids, I'll say that...I got him some fries.  Both my friend and I got the Rocky Point wrap.  It was DELICIOUS!  Spicy though- so watch out.  The fries were great, though!  There's a few wrap choices which is an awesome bonus.  So many side options too- green salad, pasta salads (didn't love my Asian one) soups, chips.  So many!

Cute lunch spot but they do dinner as well.  Check out their hours.  I'd like to go back real soon!",172

My in-laws reserved a private room which was so nice and spacious. It had a fireplace which made it feel cozy on a chilly fall November evening. There were a few kids in the group so it was nice to have our own room so as not to bother other patrons. I highly recommend keeping this in mind if you're planning a small gathering either personally or professionally. I would like to particularly thank Anthony, Clarence and Skylar (hopefully I got the spelling right) who waited on our party and did a fabulous job. They were extremely helpful, knowledgeable and patient with our group and happy to help make suggestions/recommendations on food and drink orders. There were several toasts made throughout the evening and they were always cognizant to close the double doors and to stop service while speeches were being made. My husband ordered a Filet Mignon and a side of SautÃ©ed Asparagus, I ordered the Spicy Tuna Crunch Roll, both meals were delicious. Our entire group enjoyed the meals and merriment.  I have been to other steakhouses in the area including: Fleming's, Morton's, Red, Ruth's Chris Steak House, XO Seafood And Oysters but by far received the best service and hospitality at Hyde Park Prime Steakhouse in Beachwood.

Our server was very friendly and efficient seeing as she was also managing 4 other tables. My friend and I were figuratively starving so we split an order of their supremacy fries ($8) to start. Sooooo delicious! I then got a house lemonade ($3) which I highly recommend! while my friend got a bottled grapefruit juice ($3). For the entrees, I had the unchicken and waffles ($14) and my friend had their southern combo ($14). The dishes have the same unchicken and sauteed collard greens which I might add has a ton of garlic. I love garlic but there was way too much and it really took over the whole dish. The sweet potato mash was surprisingly too sweet, as if sugar or syrup was added and my friend agreed. However, I did enjoy the waffle which had a nice chew and crispy exterior. And the most surprising thing... their unchicken strips were crunchy on the outside and moist like actual chicken! And I'm not even vegan.. nor was my friend but we were totally amazed. The only side the southern combo had that I didn't was a heaping portion of mac and cheese which I thought tasted really good as well. This is actual comfort food made for anyone! It would probably become my second home if I were to ever transition into veganism because the imitations are done exceptionally well and will probably blow your mind like it did ours. 

Overall, the only reason I took a star off is because of the overly pronounced flavours in the food but I would definitely come back again! As two non-vegans, we came here with an open mind and left with an extremely full and satisfied stomach.",318

I can't believe some yelpers commented on the decor. This isn't, and never has been, a place you are going to bring your date to and order a bottle of wine at the table. It also isn't a place you are going to ask for the ""low fat, low calorie"" dish. Chino's is a fast food place with folding tables, no servers, your meal comes in a tin throwaway plate, plastic silverware, and plastic cups. You go for the food, which combines Mexican and Chinese flavors for an incredible taste! It may not sound like it would be good, but it is and it's worth checking out. 

Good points: 
The combination of Mexican and Chinese dishes is incredible to say the least! 
If it is your first time at Chino's, you can ask to sample the dishes for free. I highly recommend this so you won't be surprised on what you order. 
You always receive a free Snicker doodle (always freshly baked that day) cookie or a Volcano (chocolate fudge cookie on weekends). 
You can create your own meal with a lot of different dishes rather than just ordering one dish. 

Bad points: 
Only a few; the Chandler location is somewhat hard to find if you have never been there. It's tucked back in behind the Walgreens. Not that big of a deal as long as you know where you are going. 
It can be a bit confusing when ordering (you fill out a small form) but just ask for help when you get there. 

The dish I always order is the following: Hengrenade Chicken (go with the Pollo Diablo if you are looking for some kick) in a homemade quesadilla, a side of Jade Red Chicken (my favorite and most popular), a side of black beans (they blend the beans with other flavors in a soupy consistency, so don't expect anything different, and these are VERY good.) with Jerk Fried Rice. This is all around $10 with a drink and will fill you up, especially with the free cookie. 

This is one of my favorite places to eat for a good, gut busting meal. Give the stone Mexican panda in the restaurant a little touch for good luck.",409

Service was top notch (and we have dined at many top restaurants). Ambiance was petite and warm with a low hum of the patrons. Upon entering we were quickly seated and a gentlemen bearing an enormous wheel of aged Parmesan and a fresh bread selection. It was an impressive start of a meal we will never regret. Throughout the dinner, our table remained clean and staff were beyond eager to remove used plates to maintain a pleasing presentation as we ate. Cocktails were handmade and wine list was impressive. I had the pesce pomodoro with white wine sauce that was the most balanced dish of this type. My husband had the branzino (Italian sea bass) cooked to perfection, filleted table side and covered with a delicate lemon butter sauce that complemented the flavor of the bass so well. The portions were more generous than most high rated restaurants in Vegas. Even though we were already so full after eating most of our entrees, we still couldn't leave without dessert. I had the creme brÃ»lÃ©e (my favorite). It was creamy, sweet and the mandatory brÃ»lÃ©e crisp cracked perfectly. My husband had the tiramisu, it as well was made with flavor that wasn't too rich and the texture was ideal without it being soggy. Once we finished up, our leftovers were packaged neatly and more fresh bread included. The bill arrived, the prices overall were much more conservative than it's peers. A captain's tip along with a generous server gratuity was given and we were on our way. The only con I can provide is that this restaurant isn't 2,000 miles away. I could eat here every day and have the elite service consistently. Needless to say, we will be back here for another amazing dining experience next fall.",307

It used to be called ""Cupcakes on Walnut"" or something like that, from my not-so-good recollection.

At any rate, I always enjoyed the scenery of the place and how cheerful the place seemed to be. The servers were usually attentive and nice. Only on occasion did I ever feel they weren't welcoming. 

I loved the novelty cupcakes from ""pink lemonade"" to ""s'mores"" - the presentation was always nice and artfully done.

It can get rather over crowded, leaving you no room to sit and savor your food. The beverages and other food items were overpriced for the quality put forth. So I don't recommend consuming those. Some cupcakes weren't worth all it was cracked up to be, but for the most part, I give this place two cupcakes up.",149

Came to Vegas to celebrate a milestone birthday - and Saturday just seemed to want us to be at Encore Beach Club the entire day/night. First, we attended Diplo, with some promoter price tickets for the guys and the ladies on a free list. Came around 11 to avoid the line - easy-peasy. We ate there, while letting the sunscreen dry, then spent the whole afternoon dancing and splashing. The staff was great, the people as well-  there was hard partying but no fights or any such ratchetness, just people from all over having the time of our lives. The rave-booty was twerk-tacular. There were spankings. The bartenders seemed to be having more fun than the people drinking. All I saw were smiles. You could see Diplo from any of the pools, except perhaps the front middle as people stand and dance in front of the DJ. We danced with our group of 8 (4 couples) and met plenty of nice people. 

As more of my group came in from all over, we came back for Marshmello Saturday night (Nightswim!), whom I hadn't seen since EDC last year. We got a great table on a lily-pad off the pool (not on the pool) just in case there was gratuitous splashing, we'd want a dry drinking spot haha. Our view was fantastic, table was perfect, the VIP even invited us into the small VIP pool behind us. 

We got a great package that started with 2 magnums of grey goose, which did great for our group. I was impressed how they handled both my large group (12 on table, 14 total that night) and the speed-bump of my credit-card declining as I forgot to tell the bank I was leaving the state. My Host Alexia, beholder of a supernatural beauty, waited patiently and kindly while I called the card and had them over-ride the security hold. She was calm and pleasant, and simply said ""this happens all the time."" (This was in stark contrast to the treatment at Omnia the night before where the bartender threatened to have my friend arrested when his card declined). 

Alexia and her runner, damn I totally forgot his name (even he was a really nice guy), treated us incredibly well. She came back and poured drinks throughout the night, not just the obligatory first round. They also made sure we stayed hydrated! Super important when it's 100 at night. They gave us just the right amount of attention and class. 

Thank you guys, and special thanks to Alvin for the rockstar treatment at the door. Saturday night was the cherry on top of my birthday weekend!! Truly I don't expect anything less from Encore/Wynn (XS, Surrender/Encore Beach Club) - I never get anything less than the best experience there, over the span of years that I have both attended with tickets and tables. They are the best, they will always be the best. 

Thanks again! :-)",503

Service; waitresses are very friendly. They will literally sit down and chat with you about dishes, or give you information on whatever you like (I've seen this done twice, and it they did it with me!)
Cauliflower with chicken was the bomb, and the crispy chicken skin was the best part

90s hip hop soundtrack was cool

Stuffed plums was great, because it utilized the natural sweetness of the plums, so it was nit overly sugary and overly dense

- The jambon was pretty much just ham and cheese, like from a sandwich, without the bread

TIPS:
If there's a wait, which there most likely will be, take a picture of menu, or persue te menu and make a game plan before seating

If you have kids, or you like science at least a smidge, you will enjoy this museum. I managed to spend almost the entire day here, exploring all of the floors and I still ended up skipping over a few exhibits.

One of the neater things about this museum is of course as a piece of architecture. It's built into the Don Valley Ravine, so the museum goes down as you explore further.

There's so much to see! At the time of my visit, there was an exhibit of kinetic art that was really beautiful. There are a lot of hands on exhibits for kids of a range of ages. There was also a Canada 150 exhibit highlighting all the cool things that Canadians have invented. 

There are a few dated exhibits, particularly in the astronomy section, the planetarium is pretty low-res, and that whole area could use an overhaul/update.

I love going here, especially on Wednesday nights when it's half-price. To be honest, unless you've got some extra money to kill, I wouldn't suggest going here any other night for a full meal because it can get pricey. I went here on a full-priced night and spent quite a bit without even trying or ordering very much at all. I wouldn't suggest coming here on Wednesday nights either without a reservation...just plan a bit ahead and you'll be sure to get a seat! 

I'm not exactly a sushi connoisseur, but in my opinion, this place has the best sushi around. I am consistently amazed by the fact that they always manage to get my orders correct and present them in a very professional manner, even on half price night.

I don't know what it is about this place, but I always feel my ""cool"" quotient going up by a power of 10 when I come in here. I kinda like going to places like that. Maybe it's the music, or the lighting, or something else, but in any case, it's a great place to go to chill and enjoy some good sushi in Cleveland.",215

That time the service was Excellent food cooked to perfection...except I don't know why everyone raves about The Twice Baked Potatoes here. It was hard as a rock and hardly any potato to eat inside. The wine selection is less to be desired. Despite all this, when our very dear friend came to Las Vegas to visit we wanted to take him here. Bob Taylor's is Not the type of Lux steak house our friend is used to, but he was excited to see just this type of sawdust joint. This time went on a Monday night. It took someone 20 mins just to come over and ask if someone was taking care of us. We were standing up and leaving when she finally came over to the table. Our friend ORDERD the Calamari. It was the only thing he ended up eating that night. He ORDERD the porterhouse steak MEDIUM. The entire thing was WAAAAYYY OVER COOKED. Well done is an understatement. My filet was fine but my Lobster Tail was WAAAAYYY OVER COOKED. Flaking apart, not wet n juicy. So we politely asked to send them back. She brought out my new Lobster Tail. Perfect! Well 35 minutes later our friends Porterhouse STILL had not come out!!! When it finally did arrive, it was RAW!! Like really really raw. Like the cook just threw it on to seer the outside on both sides but the inside was completely RAW!! Gross!!! It's like we were in the movie WAITING. So, my friend was disgusted, we were embarrassed anD asked for the check. All she did was not charge for the Steak, and take the Calamari off the bill. 
I would've given one more star but we won't be going back here since the cooks don't a crap about how your food comes out they'd just rather close the kitchen. I might add we were there 3 hours before closing time...and a party of 8 DRUNK people stumbled through the door about 5 mins before we left. Also won't be going back because management doesn't care either since we asked to speak with a manager and were told by our server that there wasn't one on the shift. It's too bad bc other than my twice baked potato on the first time went, we thought we had found our new favorite place to go and bring all our friends and family. Oh well",420

If the only requirement for your meal is that it costs less than $10, Ron's still wouldn't be your best option.

Today I ordered an ""antipasta"" (sic) salad that came with wilted lettuce, thinly sliced, low quality deli meat, rotting carrots, and an overabundance of some shredded white cheese. The entire combination filled slightly more than one quarter of the styrofoam container it came in.

On multiple occasions in the past, I have ordered hoagies from Ron's. While I have had enjoyable hoagies from Ron's, that is not the standard experience. The hoagies are very inconsistent in terms of quality, occasionally good, frequently bad. If you get a hoagie, I don't recommend one with produce on it. The produce in their hoagies is as bad as their salads.

I won't be ordering from Ron's again, despite the inexpensive menu. I'm all for a cheap meal, but only if a certain standard of quality is met. With Ron's, you are better off considering fast food.",172

The international selection was mostly bottled, but the prices were equal to other places that had them on tap.  I compare this place to Bier Markt (where I go frequently) and BM has far more beers on tap, and at the same prices as Beer Bistro charges for their bottles.

I paid to do the rental time and do it myself they were there to help me get whatever tool I needed and it was great. 


Today my alternator went out I called them and they gave me an amazing price for them to do the labor for me. They got me in on the spot. Did the swap and I drove home two hours later. 

Completely recommend going here for any diy stuff or any full service needs.",115

However, on the plus side the store is a much more affordable alternative to places like Michaels or Pier 1 Imports. There are weekly rotating specials that can take off 40-50% off the store. If you can't find what you are looking for you can download the app which takes 40% off any regularly priced item.

This location in particular seems to be well stocked and you can usually find what you are looking for. The employees are pretty helpful and the store is clean and well maintained. There is plenty of craft related stuff for DIY type people along with pre-made decor. Overall its a good shopping experience if this is the kind of stuff you are looking for.",156

Today I got the craving and decided to try Ben's brothers. The pork tasted like pork, the sauce wasn't overly sweet and there was lots of peppers, onions and carrots. No pineapple, but I didn't care.

REALLY slow. I dined in once and it took over an hour before we could leave. The waitress told us the cooks were being lazy because of a previous rush of deliveries. She also told us that the owners put far more weight into the deleveries than they do those who are dinning in and waiting. This seems backwards. If I have to wait on something I would rather be in the comfort of my own home.  We had gotten up and put our coats on when the food finally arrived.
Our waitress was far too forthcoming with the issues with the restaurant and the owners. We know that the owners are great with Italian food because they're from Egypt... Wait... What? I don't think that waitress works there anymore.

Now the conundrum of the food:
The lazagne was interesting. It had way too much liquid in it and I was ready for a horrible meal. I was surprised at the outstanding flavor though. I was ready for the very tasting looking garlic knots. Again, looks are deceiving. They were obviously bought in a can or the freezer section and they were over cooked. I couldn't even eat one. The waitress said that the good bread sells out early so they then bake this other stuff. Personally, I think they just go next door to food lion and grab it out of the freezer. 
My wife got the philly cheese steak, which was awesome. It came with fries, which were horrible. I am sure they are frozen. 

They have a large selction (although quite a few typos on the menu)
They need to reduce the amount on the menu, fix the side items, and pay a little more attention to the people seated in the restaurant.

Our solution:
What we do now is call ahead to get philly cheese steaks (it takes about 20 minutes for them to be ready) and go pick it up. After several attempts with the fries, we just don't bother anymore.",347

My chicken seemed to be slightly overcooked, and the advertised katsu sauce was not the type to which I am accustomed.  That being said. It was still tasty.  The fries were excellent, well cooked and seasoned.

So, why 4* when my sandwich was just good, not great?  Well, several things.  The staff was very nice and helpful.  The decor was very cool.

I gladly ate most of them!  The garlic noodles, while good, also seemed to be cooked with a LOT of butter, which I wasn't ready for and left a weird, heavy after-taste so we didn't finish those.  We also started with the fresh spring rolls that were delicious and their dipping sauce was good. Wish they kept siracha/other sauces on the table or brought them out right away with the food, but that is just a little thing.  Also ordered the combo rice--awesome!

The interior was a little bit more causal than I expected; the big menu across the top gave it more of a sit down fast food kind of a vibe.   Regardless, we were greeted promptly and asked if we were dining in or take out. We were handed menus and grabbed a table in the back. The waiter came over shortly with waters and a small thing of chips and salsa. The chip basket they bring out is small unlike most Mexican restaurants I have been too. But I almost prefer this because I usually just keep eating and eating and before you know it, two huge baskets of chips gone and no room for an entree. The smaller serving of chips is nice because I don't feel like I have to keep eating and I actually had room left in my stomach when my entree arrived haha. 


The menu is a little on the smaller side, but everything looked really good. I got the chicken chimichangas and my date got the Milanese chicken torta. I've also never tried horchata, so I ordered a glass. 

The Horchata was out of this world good. I highly recommend you try it. So sweet and delicious with the perfect hint of cinnamon. And while I also have never had a chimichanga before so I don't have anything I compare to, they were good! You get a serving of beans and rice with the entree. Very filling and yummy. It was fresh and hot! 

If you're looking for an affordable authentic Mexican taste, try Los Gemelos! Our waiter was friendly and helpful with suggestions, which is always a plus :)",306

Central Phoenix, a city of 1.5 million people, has exactly three private plant sellers: Whitfill Nurseries, SummerWinds Nurseries and Moon Valley Nurseries.   

So support this place before all you have left is Home Depot. 

After the Baker's closing, I had to find myself a new nursery. I can't tell you how sad that made me. I refuse to buy plants from big box stores.

I've been to Summerwinds twice now, and each time a lovely woman has been so friendly and helpful. I am new to this whole plant thing and mainly stay in the hard to kill zone, but I have no problem finding answers to all my newbie questions here. The staff is even willing to indulge me and look at pictures on my phone of my sad rubber plant with one straggling leaf. 

Although Summerwinds doesn't have the same feeling the Baker's grounds had (because Baker's was a legitimate oasis in the desert), it does have the best pottery section. Their glazed ceramic pots are beautiful and everything is incredibly organized. 

Bottom line, it's so easy to find what you need, just go already. Oh, and if you're lazy, they will even pot your plants for you. You don't even have to get your hands dirty.",226

I have been coming here for a long time now but forget to write them a review.  I think this location is pretty small compared to the other ones.  Regardless the food is still amazing.  For the price, its ridiculously good.  I salivate thinking about this place.   As a typical Korean restaurant, they start with around 3-4 appetizers.  They serve their soon tofu with a side of rice in a stone pot.  They put water in the pot for later at the end of your meal to soften to Rice.   My wife loves that part.  The mix of crispy and congee like leftovers.   For some dishes but not all, they include a raw egg for u to crack into the soon tofu when it first comes out.  What attracts me the most is the price.  For this much food, and the food is great, the price is amazing. I have been coming forever and will continue to do so.

So I got the Steak and eggs off the brunch menu.
  The steak was cooked to perfection. It's amazing how different the food tastes when you put a Latino in the kitchen. Especially since it's a  Hispanic themed restaurant.
All rightee then! They've gotten their kitchen sorted out and everything is good.
So give them a try and let us know what you think.

After circling the parking lot a couple of times and getting a spot snagged from me twice, I remembered seeing a place called Owen's just slightly further down South Blvd.  

There was plenty of parking around back and I was immediately in a better mood.  I absolutely loved the vibe in there (not to mention I was almost lured in to Polished to get my nails and toes DID). 

There was SO much to pick from on the menu and I was borderlining *hangry* so I figured I'd stick to something quick and easy and ordered a ham, egg and cheese and grabbed an OJ.  While waiting for my food (which wasn't long) I walked through the shop reading all of the fun things that customer's have written on the walls. It took me right down memory lane since as a child my Mom allowed my friends and I to use one room in my wall as a drawing board (crazy, right?)

The staff was nice, service quick and once I got home and inhaled my ham, egg and cheese I considered going back for another.  I will definitely be returning soon!",211

This place has an awesome front patio, and it's off-the-beaten path so you don't get the street traffic that plagues a lot of other outdoor patios.

On my most recent visit (only my 4th overall), I was here for a roll-off dinner with friends and co-workers as my almost three year stint in Phoenix was coming to a close. We were seated on the outside patio in the corner. The staff promptly came out and greeted us and made sure we were taken care of.

For our group of nine, they put together a great sample platter of appetizers and charcuterie. For dinner I opted for the Lamb Ragout. And for dessert, they again put together an amazing dessert sampler for us.

Needless to say, I am loving this area in Old Town. The food from House and other restaurants in this area are eons better than the other areas in Old Town, namely north and east Old Town. Great food and atmosphere.

All-in-all, this was a wonderful experience with great friends and co-workers, great food, and an awesome staff. Thanks to Tom, Tommy, RenÃ©e, Debbie, Heather, Watson, and others for making my farewell dinner such a memorable one! I cannot wait to return.",241

I am temp in AZ from CO caring for a terminally ill family member.  I needed a place to escape for relief. MSF is close.  I joined to attend yoga and pilates classes. 2 out of the 5 times I have gone to class there has been a mixup in the schedule.  Wed I noticed the online sched differed from the paper sched.  I called to find out the correct time and was given the wrong info.  Waiting with several other confused members for the class to begin, one of the said ""the yoga schedule has been jacked up lately"".  It's not easy for me to get away.  I have to hire home health care every time I leave the house.  I needed an outlet to relieve stress and get some exercise. MSF has provided the opposite.  To add to the so far awful experience, the front desk employees could care less.  AND I paid to attend a meditation class and realized I was charged 5.00 too much.  After I had to wait 20min to sign up and pay because no one at the front desk had any idea what I was requesting!  I had to direct them to the huge sign advertising the class outside the yoga room instructing to sign up and pay at the front desk.  Now I will need to spend more time and frustration trying to get my 5.00 back.   Needless to say I will be re-joining the wonderful PEORIA BIKRAM YOGA studio even though it is a long drive.

I understand that the whole idea of this restaurant is for the waiters to mistreat you and be jerks to you and your party, but it just makes for an uncomfortable experience if you want to order something else or make any additional requests such as asking for an extra utensil or a drink refill. Our waitress took our orders and immediately ran off before we could decide on an appetizer. When she came back, I told her we wanted to order an appetizer and she screamed at me saying I should've ordered ""like a big girl"" before she left the table. She didn't even give us a chance to do this because she left so quickly! Yes, I understand being rude is their concept but there should be a certain point in which they still at least try to accommodate for their guests. 

The food is nothing to rave about either. Their menu doesn't have a lot of options besides a bunch of overpriced fried food. I ordered the half rack of ribs that came with fries and the fries were stale. The ribs were a bit dry and could've used more barbecue sauce.

We also told our waitress that one of our friends in our party was celebrating his birthday and she yelled ""Nobody cares!!!!"" We thought they'd do something humorous since it was his birthday but it went completely ignored. They didn't do anything at all.

It's unlikely I will ever completely get over this anxiety, yet that's what is truly great about Dr. Rouhani and his staff - they're able to make the appointment comfortable enough that I am able to get in and get the dental care that I need. 

Every visit to Dr. Rouhani's office has been at my speed, with the utmost care and attention given to how frightened the visits make me, and no concern or issue I have is ever ignored.

I planned to go to Mariana's but I made a wrong turn, while not paying attention, and saw that Marketon was there so, whatever, might as well try it out. 

Upon walking in on 11/20/11, I was pleasantly surprised by how large the place was. This isn't some hole in the wall store, it's a full fledge grocery store, complete with an extensive hot food counter, a bakery and an enormous butcher counter. 

I spent an hour and a half browsing the aisles and drooling over the housewares and spices. The people who worked here were friendly, but I did have to pull out some of my basic spanish, mainly because I'm not going to throw a fit because I need to translate ""freshly rendered lard.""

Speaking of lard, skip the prepackaged stuff and go straight to the hot food counter to purchase the fresh stuff for literally $2. 

I had a cart full of speciality stuff and walked out for $45. Yes!",214

I booked a car through Priceline and Ace agreed to pick up my reservation. When we got to the counter, the representative tried to sell us the additional insurance that would have ended up being the same price as the price of our reservation. After arguing with her for about 15 mins about wanting to decline the extra insurance, she finally said, ""ok, I won't charge you."" She was literally telling us that we HAD to get the insurance!!! Unbelievable. Only after I said that we were going to rent a car somewhere else was when she decided to change her mind. Ace is a total scam and will try to charge their customers any way they can. We still ended up paying an additional $20, on top of what was quoted on Priceline, when I asked her what was the extra charge for she said, ""other taxes and fees."" I filed a complaint with Priceline about how they should rethink doing business with this rental company and how ACE tries to coerce customers into paying for additional insurance. I would have never picked this place if I had a choice. I am disappointed that Priceline does business with a company that is misleading and has poor customer service. I will never rent a car from ACE ever again, and I am sure to tell all my family and friends to stay away and not do business with this company.",249

After nearly three years, customers no longer have to rely on the tiny Starbuck's in Macy's for a caffeine beverage. As of this past Monday, just down the pedestrian pathway from Macy's is the Cuppa. 

  The Cuppa is just what Downtown Summerlin needed. It is a comfortable space to relax with a caffeinated beverage, a bakery treat, or sandwich. Today, I relaxed with first a cup of drip coffee then a hazlenut late. ""Relaxed"" is the key word because there were plenty of seating arrangements to relax. It's ironic that I visit a coffee house for a caffeine boost yet end up hanging out for a couple of hours mellow. 

  The Cuppa did a fantastic job with creating an inviting third place which is the term for a hangout spot outside of home and work. This is evident before stepping inside. Bordering a pedestrianized streetscape in the heart of Downtown Summerlin, the commodious patio attached to The Cuppa gives the passers-by a subconscious message that this is a place to stop and relax. On a cool April afternoon this was the place to enjoy a hazlenut late. The patio is furnished with tables and sofas. This is the ideal spot for Downtown Summerlin people watching. The inviting environment also permeates the large coffee shop. The walls are adorned with pictures of funny sayings. Halfway into the coffee shop is a library surrounded by plush seats. Bordering the left wall are plate glass windows overlooking Downtown Summerlin. To the right the counter takes up a large portion. 

    I walked to the counter on two occasions to order. The overhead menu made ordering simple. Off the menu, I ordered a medium coffee that costed $2.55 then later a medium hazlenut late that came to around $5.25. Both times, a friendly batista welcomed me. And both times they were in a mug. 

  I thought more highly of the hazlenut late than the coffee. This is one of the deals where the quality was high but I personally did not agree with the taste. It's one of those deals where several people would greatly appreciate it. It is a personal taste thing. Maybe next time I'll try the pour over. On the other hand, the hazlenut late was a taste that I preferred. What is nice is that there is a list of flavors to create the late. Next time I can switch it around with another flavor. I must add that it has a sweet taste for a sugar free syrup. 

  The Cuppa is the missing piece that completed the Downtown Summerlin puzzle. Finally after 2.5 years, Downtown Summerlin is home to a coffee shop where you can spend time in a relaxing setting with a quality caffeinated beverage.",487

They are course ground and not smooth which may turn some off but they are terrific.  The salad was on point, it had these thick pieces of bacon that we referred to as bacon croutons.  My least favorite were the chicken and biscuits.  Like I said earlier, I'm a breast man and the chicken pieces were thighs which I did not like.

Bottom line, service was solid, food was great, kind of pseudo family style were most everything can be shared.  The grits were soooooo good I was kicking myself for not ordering the shrimp and grits.",145

I waited about 10 minutes until my drink came out, but didn't really mind since it was a good turn around time with the crowd that ordered before me.Overall, it was a solid milk tea and the boba had a good texture and taste!

Stayed at the Venezia tower the first two nights and was woken up every morning at 5am from a door slamming. Our room was at the end of the hallway and the door that was being slammed I believe was a janitors closet or some kind of employee exit. The slamming wasn't just once but every 5-10 minutes. Come on people it's vegas people don't sleep until 5am. Called the front desk and they moved me rooms into the Venetian tower...... Glad that we were moved but there was a problem in that room as well. Us girls started to get ready for the night and as I was showering the water wasn't going down the drain. Called the front desk again they said they will have someone fix it. I told them we don't have time we need to get ready for the night. The lady then said call back after your done getting ready and we will send someone up. SERIOUSLY gross who wants to take a shower standing in water that isn't going down the drain after someone showers. Seriously lady. She finally said they will move us again for the second time. Moved into the new room and of course something else is wrong with it. The bathroom door doesn't close and the toilet doesn't flush right. For all this money we spent at this hotel I rather would have stayed at the Luxor and gotten a suit. The lady at the front desk was rude as well and didn't want to help out. The only reason I have one star was because I couldn't give a negative one. Never coming here again.,287

ITADAKIMAS!!

This place is authentic. 
You'll find several decent types of sake and small plates here, from Shisamo to hamachi kama.
if you have not had either, you should try it. Their agedashi tofu is also awesome.

They have both tonkatsu ramen and also miso ramen. Buddy of mine has the latter and i think it is better than the tonkatsu ramen. The tonkatsu is good, but the broth of the miso ramen looked so rich and flavorful.

I had a few pieces of sashimi but the plan is to go back for more.",100

They could at least give you a postcard size for memories. I opted out on paying for the photo it wasn't that good.

Our girl tour guide had an amazing personality wish I remembered her name. She was so much fun, she was very interactive and informative. The Thor room was the highlight for my son. He is absolutely obsessed with Thor so having that hammer was the icing on the cake.  He still talks about it.

The tour took about an hour and overall it was a lot of fun. There is also a gift shop with lots of things to purchase.

Dirty, old, Crown Victoria, that had the front seat full of junk. So the two of us got in back seat. Or TRIED to. Driver had the seat slid back so far, there was only room for one in the backseat. Until we asked the driver to move up so we could both get in. He moved up enough we SQUEEZED in. Driver then proceeded to weave in and out of traffic while eating watermelon from a plastic tray in the front seat junkpile.

I am in my early 20s and have suffered from acne for all my life. When I walk into Eyebrow Envy to get my eyebrows and/or face to be threaded I am not ridiculed for my acne and told I have 'pimples' etc. The girls work with my skin and always treat their customers with respect. Unlike other locations in Las Vegas, the staff does not speak in another language behind the customers back and that is a huge plus. Eyebrow Envy is also very clean, no loose threads on the floor, etc.

Also, ask for Susan, she is great! She takes her time and is accommodating to what the customer wants and ensures you are happy when you leave. The staff is professional and courteous.

They offer speed boat cruises and rafting trips.
 I have only tried the rafting so far, and it was absolutely amazing. The Lachine rapids are quite a bit more impressive when you are rafting then when you observe them from the shore, and the ride was quite wild on occasion. This said, the rafts are bigger and more sturdy than others I have used for white water rafting on smaller rivers. There are 8 people to a raft plus a guide who will graciously fish you out of the water should you happen to fall in. As I did. The rafting trip itself takes about 3 hours, including the return trip upstream in an old school bus.

Prior to the rafting the group gets a short lesson in safety, and everybody is equipped with a helmet and life vest.

And prior to the safety instructions you can wait, and wait, and wait. This is why I am only giving this three stars. I was told to be on site by 1 pm, and then nothing happened till 3 pm. Since there is not much around and I was alone, I was pretty much bored out of my mind by that time. I think the reason was an error in planning or communication, because some other customers arrived later. Since you have to reserve your spot at least one day ahead via the phone, I don't quite understand why they did not ask all of us to be there at the same time. 

Anyhow - the rapids are amazing and this company is the only show in town for rafting, so I would go again (and bring a book).",303

The owners are incredible people who strive to create a fun, outrageous, unique atmosphere - all the while, they're super friendly (them and the staff) and immediately make you feel at home, remembered, and cared for. The bar is run by artists who participate in charitable efforts - and to that, I tip my hat. Their security is always professional and friendly. 

I'm not sure if they still have food, but when they did/if they do, it was quick, super quality and homemade. Not a huge menu (i.e. this is not a dinner date destination, per say, unless you're looking for super laid back and casual fair), but what you get is/was tasty. 

The nights vary so you would benefit from checking in with them to see what the night will bring. They are known for their live music nights, which I enjoy, and I will pop in on a weekend night from time to time -  though I prefer weekday nights and after work times as the Fri and Sat pretty mainstream pop/party music isn't really my thing. The burlesque on the bar thing - they were doing it before it was even a thing in Toronto - ahead of their time.

I stopped by and the options were healthy, fresh and creative. It's a drive thru location, with some outside seating. The goal for them is to provide healthy options via drive thru as an alternative to the unusual drive-thru fare. They have lots of creative and classic options for various palates and you may add additional proteins if you'd like at a very reasonable additional cost. The servings are surprisingly generous given that the salads are under $6. Addition protein varies between $1.5 and $2. I ordered the southwest Caesar and it was fresh, crisp and made to order. The dressing was a creamy poblano that added just a little heat that went so well with the crisp radishes and fresh veggies. This place will not disappoint!  
I also tried their mango iced tea (unsweetened) and it was delish! It had a little sweetness to it and that was a perfect accompaniment to my salad. :)

Honestly I was not rude and and always try to be pleasant, but little miss attitude was obviously not happy being there!

It's hard to see in the picture but I'm not a heavy eater, but rubios please put beans in a bean burrito!! As I've reviewed rubios before, I really like their no fried beans...they really are good! I just wish this location would work on employee's personalities and assigning someone to get online orders out...this isn't the first time it has happened at this location...it's consistent.

Of course the abalone! I haven't been here for lunch, but I heard the dim sum here are decent too. The shark fin soup is also very delicious as it's heated up at your table! Their seafood options are great here too. Depending on the season, you can get the Alaskan king crab, big lobsters or jumbo live shrimp. All very good!

The abalone usually comes with duck feet so if you're not a fan of duck feet, let them know to substitute it with something else. 

I had the quail too. It was alright. I didn't think it was crispy enough and didn't have much flavor. Make sure you dip it in the worcheshire sauce and the mixed salts for a better taste. 

The jumbo shrimp was fresh and very juicy. This is a seasonal seafood so ask if they have it available. There was lots of meat in each of the shrimp. Usually boiled and you'll need to dip into their soy sauce in order to enjoy this dish. 

LAST TIP?!

They only take cash or debit so make sure you come prepared! I suggest you take a look at the combo dinners to see if anything excites you. Always ask what kind of seasonal seafood they have in store and whether they have any specials going on.",232

We walked in and the place was pretty empty. The cashier greeted us and took order right away!  We found a table and waited and waited...finally our food arrived and I realized the wait was for them cooking it up right then! Yesss!!!

I chose the fish tenders and fries combo. I've had it before, but it was much better this time since it was nice and hot!

 I was a little disappointed in two things from my visit, first the fries were cold! If you took the time to make the fish why not the fries??? And they charged me $.10 for a cup of water?!? Really??? 

But I mean overall, I left full and the food was pretty good. So I will be back!",163

Whenever I was in Atlanta, I'd stop to get boba tea from the Asian venues because they could not be found back home. Over time, many Asian establishments started carrying their version of boba tea but the taste was always lacking. There was always something missing. 
Welcome to the opening of Tea Fusion. Not only was I amazed from my first order of mango tea refresher, but I've become an even bigger fan after every visit and order since. This place is consistently amazing. Every drink, every banh mi, every choice is delicious. The sandwiches are filled with meat and topped with the most scrumptious and tangy pickled carrots. The drinks are the perfect balance of sweetness, tang, and fruit. The refreshers put Starbucks and Panera to shame. Pick your poison. They are all outstanding. 
There's a sign at the register that tells you up front they do not offer refunds because they stand behind all of their products. I stand with them in this sentiment. If you don't like what you've ordered, it's not because they didn't do It well, it's because you have bad tastebuds. It's ok if you don't believe me.

Based on my first impression...perfectly adequate.  The work stations and equipment are clean, the prices are reasonable.  I had a very nice pedicure in a comfortable chair and a good gel manicure.  I felt like she had very good attention to detail with my gel manicure.  Of course we'll have to see how long it lasts.

The salon itself could use some attention.  Like I said - the work stations are clean, but the faux plants are dusty and there is stuff just stashed randomly in corners that clearly hasn't been touched in ages.  The childs pedicure chair near the nail station I was at had a thick coat of dust on the back.

I would have never thought to try something called bison meatloaf but holy moley it was so delish (minus the spinach sorry I can't get with the spinach on anything). The spicy thai salad had a pleasant little kick of spice but not crazy crazy spicy  (I appreciate that). The chicken ploblano with tamale cakes was also very yummy.

It is almost a year later and it is JUST getting equipment in it. But yet they still of course charge you for the amenities you cannot use. I've had my front door swell up so badly that you literally cannot open it. You have to kick the door open. The closet in the laundry room won't open. Period. My front door was put on crooked so there is a HUGE gap at the bottom that scorpions love crawling through- and I have a 3 year old running around.

After telling her that I found her business via Yelp, she ranted for a little while about people on the internet, which was halfway between charming and uncomfortable. 

When we got down to business however, I was very impressed. I showed her how much I wanted the coat taken in she swiftly told me that it would not be possible without major expense, and gave a very satisfactory explanation of why the expense would be what it was. She also showed me how much she could take it in without making the coat look silly or requiring serious alterations to the shoulders and sleeves. She suggested that the difference probably wasn't worth it, and told me that I probably shouldn't worry about the coat being a little big for the occasion I was going to be wearing it to.

I am always happy to find people who care enough about the integrity of their work that they will give a suggestion that turns away business. From what I can see, customers at AJ's can be certain that Annie will not do only what her customers ask, but will give her earnest advice on what should be done.",209

Hung out at the bar for a while. Mostly piss and shite on tap so I stuck to Leinenkugel's Summer Shandy in a can - best beer for lakes and state parks where they don't allow you to bring beer in bottles cause of their no glass policy. So we chilled and got toasted on the company dime while the rest of our co-workers showed up. Once we were all there we went upstairs in a big group to where we had a number of bays in a row rented out for our use. Some of the folks we work with are avid golfers who do this all the time. Me? Not so much. But there's nothing like getting toasted and slamming a little ball out into wherever - especially once someone told me to imagine that little golf ball is your boss. Bam! You hit that little booger out and I guess you're supposed to aim for various targets and a series of concentric circles around them decide what your score is depending on where your ball landed. Didn't matter - I was playing a different game than everyone else was apparently - just taking out my frustrations on a little white ball. Then food came. It was mostly little sliders, chicken fingers and chips - stuff you can get at most dive bars. Not ever gonna reminisce about that when talking about TopGolf. Afterwards when it got dark and our time was up we headed back downstairs to the bar. Got more drinks. Then someone had the idea of playing giant Jenga upstairs so we went to this courtyard type area where you can order from a bar and they also had a bunch of giant Jenga bricks. Stupid kid's game but it's fun after you had enough to become a stupid kid again. Played a few games and then my designated driver had to leave so I went too. All in all great place for a company-sponsored event. Not sure if I'd ever come on my own but I'm not a golfer anyway. Lots of parking - they have a pretty big lot. Your mileage, as always, may vary greatly.",384

Have you ever been to Golden Corral buffet? Well, GC is better than this buffet. BY FAR. Not only was the price for what you get, totally shit, it lacked amounts of offerings. Three dinky rows during dinner? Not worth it. They offer the buffet for breakfast, lunch and dinner. We tried it for dinner on the first night and said nope, not coming here again. The prices on their website also are incorrect. It is $33 for the dinner buffet, and extra for any drink at all. I assume they fluctuate their pricing based on busy times.

The best part was the dessert offerings. Save your $$ for gambling and just eat elsewhere.",153

It's a great location and certainly a trendy night spot.  I give kudos to the hostesses for helping us pull together several tables and being patient while we waited for our colleagues to arrive after they got lost.

Sort of strange though how we would order drinks from our server and each time they would get delivered it would be a different server and we kept having to tell the drink delivery person who ordered what.  

Personally the drinks are overpriced at $9 for Bombay Gin for example.   My co-workers who were drinking though the drinks were weak especially at the $9 mark.  Likewise it took three people to find me a glass of water without ice and lemon.

The food was just okay - but when you pay these prices and are in a trendy location I really expected more.  Two dishes out of 10 people were sent back and finally one was removed from the bill.  The sea salt chips were great as an appetizer but I thought my salmon was really overcooked.  Again, it wasn't bad, but I expected more.

I probably wouldn't go back, as when I travel I like to find really good places to eat and when the place doesn't give me a good vibe I just move on to discover something else.  I wish them the best, but it seemed like the customers were there more because it was the ""trendy place to go"" and not because the food was outstanding. 

 Again, I think the hostesses did the most, the original server was great - but in a party of 10 we shouldn't have to raise our hands to see who ordered what each time the drinks arrived.  I would expect than at a place for beer specials and not an average of $9 bucks a pop.",327

From the first service Jim went through my bike thoroughly, and showed me where he replaced a nut that apparently has a habit of vibrating and falling off.  Problem is if you don't know where to look (or don't care) you won't find it.  Jim not only found it, but fixed it, no charge.  
Every time my ride is serviced Jim takes me through not only what he fixed, but also shows me other issues he's ""tracking"" that don't need to be fixed yet, but in time will probably become an issue to the point where ""it'll be worth it"" to get it fixed.  Not many repair places I know do that!  Most just want as much of your money as they can get, as soon as they can get it.
This place is family owned, and small, so if you want a fleet of people greeting you and opening the door for you, then look elsewhere.  But if you want an honest shop at a fair price, this is the only place on the west side of Phoenix I can recommend.

The hype is real folks, it took me 5 times (yes 5 times) to traverse the line and get the ribs and fatty brisket and it was very tasty. Both are cooked perfectly, great smoke rings, juicy, and the ribs fell off the bone. You could easily eat the ribs off the bone with a plastic fork, they're that tender. 

They had a pastrami brisket special today that was exceptional, I made a sandwich with it and the classic white bread, pickles and onions they provided. The pickles and onions added a nice texture and acidity that helped balance out the Q and when paired with the pillowy soft white bread made for a great dish. 

If I had a minor nitpick with the food it would be that the meats were a bit over salted for my personal taste, but the 3 different tasty sauces helped balance that out. 

The only issue is the wait, it's long. If you are a lover of BBQ it is well worth the wait, but if you want some of the more popular meats like the fatty brisket and ribs you better get there at 11am at the latest, which some days might even be too late and expect to wait close to 2 hours. Hopefully when they open the Sunnyslope location it might lighten up a bit. 

ADDITIONAL TIP
Your best bet is get a few friends together, call a week in advance and put in a order to pick up. You have to order 5 lbs. of meat and it has to be 7 days in advance, but if you have a group of 4-5 it can be easily done and you won't have to wait.",306

Although the staff was extremely polite and professional, I would guess it is because they are afraid of Dr. C. Gidwani's wrath.  Dr. C. Gidwani was rude and abrupt in a saccharin sweet way. Especially after I called to clarify policies with her office not honoring advertised pricing with a business organization we are both part of and they called her to question it.  Because I was coming in with a horrible tooth ache and had already waited over a week for the appointment, I didn't get up and leave,  but I should have. 

This is what happened at this visit:

1. She didn't really do an exam of my teeth. She just looked at the  three xrays her assistant took, then looked only at two of the three teeth because I mentioned that I had lost the fillings in those teeth.  She then tapped on the one that was hurting and declared they would have to send me to a specialist even though their office does root canals. And I still don't know why I need a specialist.

2. I don't know if she purposefully drilled out tooth #1/3 to the point that it now needs a root canal (that she could do right then, of course) or not but I'm also not convinced she didn't. 

3. She told me she would put a temporary filling in #1/3 to hold it until after 8/1/14 when my insurance kicks in to cover the root canal. She did. A strange clay-like putty that  i was charged $77 for and will come out as soon as I brush my teeth. 

4. Now to tooth #2/3.  I knew it would need a build up then a crown because part of the tooth had broken off with the filling so I wasn't surprised when she told me that is what it needed.  What did surprise me though was that I asked for composite instead of amalgam for the build up and she refused out right, with no explanation other than she was putting in amalgam.  When I questioned her further, she got upset and abruptly told me that it was because the tooth needed a crown.  I get it, no problem, but why not just explain that nicely, instead if being argumentative and outright refusing to honor your customer's request?

5.  While checking out with the receptionist I notice that when i run my tongue over the filling she just put in on #2/3 that it feels sharp so I let the dental assistant know and she clears it with the Dr take me back to the exam room again.  When Dr Gidwani comes in the room, she is, again, very abrupt and confrontational. When I tell her what's wrong, she doesn't believe me and has to feel for herself telling me that she will only change it if it is sharp. She then drills the tooth, slightly, and asks me to check it. Still sharp, so she drills more and before I can even feel it, says, ""Is there anything else before I take my gloves off again?"" 

At that point, I just left. I don't understand why she treated me this way other than that I politely questioned her about a couple of things. I have problems with my teeth and I have had enough work done over the years to understand things aren't always what they seem until the dentist gets into the tooth, however, there is NO excuse for a medical ""professional"" to make a patient, especially a new one, feel like they can't ask questions and be a part of their treatment without repercussions from said ""professional."" 

If you value having a say in your dental treatments, I would stay away from this dentist. Total bill for being treated like this and for shoddy work unbecoming of a dentist ""Serving this Valley for 25 years,"" $420.  Now I have to find another dentist and pay more money that I don't have now to have this mess fixed. Thank you Dr. Gidwani for such a horrible experience! I was treated better and had better work done by the STUDENTS at Midwestern University!  I'm sure my boys won't mind starting school without new clothes!",746

I ordered the oatmeal breakfast. I figured it wasn't a giant tray of food. It would be hot and come pretty quickly. Well, it was hot and did come pretty quickly but I was wrong if I thought that it wasn't going to be huge. They brought out a trough of oatmeal. I wish I was kidding but I'm not. I talked into that bowl for a good 20 minutes and hardly made a dent. Along with the bowl of oatmeal, there were many fresh fruits, types of sugars, and dried fruits and nuts. It was probably one of the best bowls of oatmeal I'd ever had. If you're running from place to place while in Vegas and you need to grab something for breakfast, I recommend the oatmeal because it came very quickly to my table.

I've been growing and also a consumer of Cannabis for over 20 years. Maybe it's because I come from different product standards in Cali, but this place sells old, dried out bud for high quality prices and after spending about $1000 every 5 days and receiving dried out bud almost every time, I finally mentioned something to the manager when I got a half ounce and it was the most dry bud I've ever seen. Her response was that she could give me 10% off another eighth. All the bud was still in the container. 

Just because they're the biggest store doesn't mean their anywhere near good quality - it's all a hype. 
BUYERS BEWARE: don't let the size fool you. This place lacks quality. You just lost a loyal and high spending customer. Set up your game!

And then he looked at me really angrily and annoyed and said you need to hurry and then walked away.

The jerk chicken plates are a good value; they come with rice and peas, coleslaw, and slice of toast. The jerk isn't the greatest, and it's not that hot, but it hits the spot.

The fish cakes are also a good value(4 for $4), but are a bit bland, so make sure to get tamarind sauce.

I hear the rotis are pretty good, but have yet to try them.

My son went here when he was younger and i had NO problems, my daughter recently was a victim of an assault and came here and finally opened up and was in a program they offer here and had a bad experience with a male worker whom was very professional the supervisor patricia was very professional and took care of it unfortunately my daughter quit going. Recently she called to make an intake appointment because she was feeling down and needed to speak with someone again. She called the intake center and was told by a lady named Carla/Karla that their were no appointments available and to call her health insurance provider and find somewhere wlse to go. I grabbed the phone and asked Carla wjat did she mean no appointments none this week this month? Her response was at all ever. This made me furious how can u have 0 appointments ever and this is mental health care. When i asked to speak to Carlas supervisor she told me she is the supervisor and NO ONE is above her! I found this odd and told her i know for a fact Supervisors dont set appointments for clients. She then hung up on me and kept hanging up on me refusing to give me the information. I had to call the glendale offuce and get the Supervisor from there to contact me. When Patricia contacyed me nothing was done to Carla and all i was told is for my daughter to call back and try and set up an appointment again with the intake department and if Carla answers to hang up and call again until she gets someone else who can help her. This is very very unprofessional and i will NEVER recommend this place to anyone who suffers with mental health issues! That call to Carla has set my daughter into a severe depression and she refuses to seek help now from being trated this way. I cant believe that JFCS can have such a horrible person working in mental health as an intake person and turning the mental ill away like this! This girl needs to be fired and help responsible and im sure my daughter isnt the only victim of CARLAS!! Those calls are recoded for a reason and shame on u JFCS for not firing or even investigating this woman who made my child feel worthless in this already cruel world! Every day i have begged my daughter to call another facility and seek help unfortunately she wont and shes 20 and i cant force her. Thanks CARLA i hope you never have a child who has to seek mental help and deal with someone like yourself!",457

Let me start by saying that I enjoy what I call ""casual elegance."" I like good upscale food, in a modern, casual atmosphere, with a laid back nice, but down to earth vibe. Somewhere like SIX PENN Kitchen or something. I decided to come here after reading many great reviews on Yelp. This place is comical, trys wayy to hard!

It is very small, tables very close. Low ceiling/dark paint so it feels very claustrophobic. It does describe itself as a lounge so I will give them that; if you like swanky lounge vibe this place is actually pretty nice. Too dark and small for my liking. The waiter, dressed in his skinny jeans and pompadour brought over a bottle of tap water to pour. We politely decline b/c I didn't want water so why waste it..ya know. He seemed offended that I didn't want water, he offered us wine, and we declined, I just wanted a diet coke because I was on call for work and could not drink. He became aloof, almost took it as a personal assault that we didn't want wine!

I ordered an appetizer and the waiter asked my BF which one he wanted, the waiter said, ""Oh you want to share the appetizer"" I said I assumed it was for 2 people, as most appetizers at almost any place can serve more than one person, and it didn't specify that they were single serve. The waiter was rude, as if I should have already known this information. 

So we were brought bread, a variety and this was actually fantastic. I was thinking that my meal would be great and the stuffy atmosphere would be worth it...I was wrong. I had pork shoulder that tasted like Walmart/enhanced meat. It was tough, fatty. Served with puree sweet potato that tasted like baby food. BF had ""seared"" tuna, that was just rubbery, nasty, no flavor. I'd give the meal 4/10...no lie a pork dinner from Bob Evans is better. 

I think this place needs to learn that sometimes less is better. Simple dishes can be better, dont need a thousand ingredients to be good. Overall the the atmosphere is what kills it. Its forced elegance. 

Pass. There are plenty of good places in the Burgh that have excellent food, but are comfortable and laid back, but still elegant.",431

WORST EXPERIENCE.

first impressions: walked in and had to wait for the receptionist/technician to get off her phone.

I had an appointment at 3 which didn't up starting till 3:40pm because she was too busy arguing with a prior customer. this was one of the most unprofessional services I have seen, heard and witnessed at a business. 

application process: nervous. I've gotten eyelash extensions before at great locations however i decided to try this place out since it was 5 minutes away. WORST mistake. i am well aware that a proper eyelash application takes at the very least 1 full hour. i was done in 40 min... and then was told just to rest for the lashes to set in. this was my biggest red flag. you should not need to lay their for 20 minutes to let the lashes set. not only did the technician leave me for 20 minutes to talk with her co-worker but she also felt the need to argue when I told her that a few of the lashes were not where they should be and that i was not happy. she fixed them... but she did not care as she rushed though it. 

i could list more negitive points about BeautyRex however, I do highly recommend that you avoid and really find another location that will treat their clients with great service and do a proper job for what they pay. 

If you are looking for proper professionals.... check out Sparks Salon. one of the best in the city.",271

There are no drinking bars, stores, or gambling in this resort. You have to drive or take a taxi to get to those kind of places. It is about a ten minute drive away from the strip. Those were the reasons why I gave this place three stars. I came here since my parents wanted to go here. If you have kids and you still want to go to Vegas, this place is definitely safe for the kids.

The swimming pool area is like going to a neighborhood community pool in the mid-morning time I went. Meaning there were a lot of kids.

The fitness area is separated into two areas: a strength room and cardio room. The strength room is small. If you see more than two people working out in here, I would probably come back until one of them leaves.

The staff are friendly and understanding. Average response time when we needed something in our room was about 10 minutes. Longest wait was 20 minutes.

Lastly, our room is nice and clean. There is a kitchenette was at least kitchenware for six people. Two HDTVs, one in the bedroom and one in the living room. Spacious indeed. There is a pullout bed sofa.",219

Our waiter Sean was extremely helpful and gave great recommendations. Not only that, but he was also attentive. My friend and I were sitting literally next to a heat lamp and the waiter noticed my friend becoming uncomfortable with all the heat and modified it.

They have a great drink selection. I ordered the Hendersons Best, which is from a local brewery and it's a refreshing amber ale.

For an appetizer, we got a charcuterie with 5 meats (chefs choice and all delicious) with cheese. We also got the sourdough bread with hummus dip which also goes well with the charcuterie.

For my entree, I have the Wild Boar Rigatoni which was AMAZING!! It was a hot fresh pasta which went well on a cool night, and the boar had a delicious flavor. The pasta was served with a nice goat cheese which melted into the pasta sauce when stirred, and with fresh pepper, wow. 

The ambience was great, and it's in a great location that allows for karaoke, dancing, drinking, etc.

Even with all the options available, 800 Degrees stands head and shoulders above any other place I've visited.

This location is really nice, with high ceilings and clean decor, but the most beautiful feature of the restaurant is all of the pizza toppings! A twenty-foot-long buffet of them, I think...perfect cubes of butternut squash, fresh mozzarella, bunches of thyme, sweet roasted garlic, slices of eggplant, a variety of different hot peppers, caramelized onions, artichoke hearts, rosemary oil, on and on. 

You can choose from the list of pre-designed pizzas on the wall, or customize your own. Plus, there non-pizza options as well--salads, and burrata with your choice of accompaniments (beets and balsamic, prosciutto and melon, etc.), meatballs, broccolini.

The pizzas are perfect, though, with crisp edges and soft middles. If you like spicy, request some of their chili pepper nonsense on the side. Spicy and incredibly flavorful, almost a buffalo sauce type of thing going on. Perfect for dipping bites of crust. I love the Tartufo, with truffle cheese, mushrooms, roasted garlic, and arugula.

This is pizza to enjoy when you're on your game, not the stuff you get to soak up the excess amounts of alcohol sloshing around in your stomach.",215

Last night my boyfriend and I went on a double date to Metro Brasserie for Valentines day. This particular Valentines happened to be particularly significant for us. We had plans to start dinner at 6, grab some ice cream down the street, and had reservations at another function after at 8. 

Upon arriving we found that our reservation was not for the correct time, however they were not busy at all and got us a nice table (right on the walkway) out on the patio. When our server finally decided to come and take our drink order, we had had enough time to know our complete order, drinks, apps, and entrees. When 7:15 rolled around we still did not have our entrees, someone came by and told us that one of our stakes was overdone, had to be re-fired and that it would be about 5-7 minutes longer. At 7:45 we FINALLY received our food, my boyfriends burger was much too rare and sent it back (at that time we realized the server never asked how he would like it cooked). Since we had reservations elsewhere at 8:00 we threw all of our food into to-go boxes at an attempt to make it. 

We talked to a manager (who happened to be the person who told us that it would be 5-7 minutes longer PSH!) he took 50% off our bill, leaving our total bill for 4 people at $150! To top it all off, in our rush to make our next reservation WE FORGOT OUR FOOD WE DIDN'T GET TO EAT ON THE TABLE! 

I am so unbelievably upset that we choose to spend an extremely special night here and ended up, hungry, pissed off, AND missed our next reservation. I will NEVER EVER EVER tell anyone one good thing about this restaurant, and it looks like were not the only ones.

The food is incredible and you can tell the people that run it are super-appreciative of everyone that comes through the door. They are very proud of their food and they make sure to tell you it's all made in house - i.e. no cans of anything. The lady that served us must have significant influence on the food as she told me she is from Mexico City so a lot of the food made is from the city's influence. I told her I was visiting MC in January and she encouraged me to try some enchiladas down there to prove the similarities.

The enchiladas I had were unlike any I've ever had. Perhaps this is how they are supposed to be? The chicken was not wrapped in a tortilla. The two tortillas were sautÃ©ed in green chiles, folded over and laid at the bottom of the dish. It was then topped with lettuce, chicken, crema and all the other good stuff. It was the best I've ever had. I mean it.

Warning: When the dish indicates it's spicy, it's spicy. Those were the spiciest enchiladas I've ever had, but I appreciate the spice. My gf, however, was fortunate in her decision to get the carnitas because she would have not been able to handle the enchiladas. 

By the way, the carnitas were excellent, as well.

This place gets five stars and I can't wait to go back. Please, please try this place. It was empty when I walked in and that's a shame. They should have a lot more business if it was all based on the quality of their food and service. It's also very affordable. Chicken enchiladas were $9 and the carnitas were somewhere around there (maybe $12).",300

My brother in-law came into town on a tour and when I looked at this venue's website I couldn't wait to visit the place- the site creator has a great sense of humor and everything looked well put together. When we got there I was a bit sketched out, I didn't realize that there was a part of Scottsdale that wasn't safe to walk around at night in. Like the website says, they have about 10 or 15 spots, but there are places to park in the surrounding neighborhoods. However, I wouldn't advise walking late at night in that area and despite what they say, their neighbors do care that you are using their streets to park in and stumble back to your car late at night.

When I got there I saw my brother's band setting up and went to go talk to them. They weren't too happy because their guarenteed payment wasn't guaranteed the moment they got there and the venue was now charging a cover which wasn't disclosed to them when they booked the venue. I mean who charges a cover on a Tuesday and doesn't even give their bands a portion of that cover? We were housing all of the bands (8 people) and they were never told about the cover so we didn't bring cash (I also wouldn't recommend having cash on you -or valuables of any kind- in that part of town) and they didn't have a list of any kind unless you were in the band. This included people who were helping the band set up because they do not offer help with set up even after telling the bands that they do when they were setting up the performance scheduling. I've heard them play a ton and when helping them set up I saw the venue was a wreck so we just left after they were done with set up. 

On an interesting note, there were more people in the bands than patrons visiting the bar- I wonder why... This place seems awesome until you get there and realize that the place is sketchy, they don't keep their word, and couldn't care less about the people who play there.",378

It's called Front Row because it holds just under a hundred people and you are right there on the stage with the actors. It makes for an intimate evening and you really feel like you are part of the play.

I asked the waitress what the most popular item is on the menu. And she said her absolute favorite was the Tuna Fish Melt. She said it so passionately that I just had to try it. I ordered that with fries. 
The wait was not long, and the sandwich was pretty ok. I just wish that it had just a little bit more flavor to it. But all in all, pretty decent. The service was very pleasant, and so I will return to try out another item.

The ice skating rink located in the heart of downtown Phoenix is beautiful. One of the most creative ideas to the valley of the sun. The setup is nicely displayed with a HUGE Christmas tree beautifully decorated that lights up giving a glow on the ice. I'm the middle of the street between two buildings it is definitely a glimpse of the east coast where cooler weather permits for this. 

Though beautiful I did not have the beat experience. The location had plenty of staff. Very young crew who only played around. My first encounter was the cashier which were two very unfriendly ladies who gathered $15.00. With no direction on what to do next I turned the corner where six employees talked and goofed off the whole time. As I arrived right at 5pm when they first opened for the evening they had plenty of time to horse around. I was given the wrong skate size once I finally got someone to help me. I returned the skates only to realize even with the correct shoe size they are the most uncomfortable skates I have ever worn. It was so bad I last only a quick moment to snag a picture and had to leave the ice. Sadly I was not alone as other people trickled in they complained about the skates as well.

I returned the skates and so did my friend which had her first experience skating. Are skates were snatched out of our hand only to be told by an employee who works there that the skates they provide are terrible and they bring their own.

I did not ask for a refund. I just left. I recommend if you decide to go there and pay $15 be sure to bring your own skates.",315

I don't often dish out 5 star reviews for restaurants, particularly after the first try. However, the food here was AMAZING!!! Between my husband and me, I was able to try two meatballs (Classic Beef and Spicy Pork), three sauces (Creamy Parmesan, Mushroom Gravy, and Tzatziki), and two sides (Penne and Mac & Cheese). Everything was absolutely incredible! I could pour the Creamy Parmesan sauce on almost any food, and the Tzatziki sauce was a perfect combination with the Spicy Pork meatball.

In addition to incredible food, the service was very good, and the decor was modern and trendy. I cannot wait for the 2nd and 3rd floors of Sienna Mercato to open, Mezzo (pizza and wine) and Il Tetto (rooftop beer garden). I will definitely be back!",176

We only wanted wine by the glass (the wine list here is huge, and takes up a few blackboards on the walls), and was very happy with the service - the waitress asked us our preferences then came back with a few bottles to try, before we decided on what we wanted to actually have. This is something I haven't seen done before, and even though it's only a little thing, it makes a big difference to the experience.

The menu itself was interesting, and obviously changes regularly. We started with squid stuffed with lobster - it was good, but I wasn't blown away by it. The seafood here seems to be taken seriously, so I would recommend trying it when coming (I saw someone else eating the oyster plate, and had instant meal-envy). 

I had the ribs as my main, and they lived up to expectations - the meat was cooked spot-on, the sauce good and thick, and plenty of chips. I didn't expect to have such a meal at a 'gourmet' establishment, but I definitely enjoyed it.

For the dessert we had homemade doughnuts and a chocolate brownie. Both were really good (the doughnuts reminded me of Aussie doughnuts - lots of cinnamon), but I think the brownie was the winner.

The place itself is warm and cosy, and makes a great 'date venue.' It isn't cheap, but you do get quality service, food, and good atmosphere (if you want cheap, there's a 
Dilallo Burger down the road!).",267

It ended up being absolutely awesome. They rocked out for 2 full hours. The show has an intermission after about 90 minutes. Full of 80's hits! The show not only has great music but also an entertaining storyline that fits together well and keeps you curious as to what's going to happen with certain plot scenarios. 

I love all types of music, but primarily hip hop. Even still, I knew all of the words to 85% of the songs at RoA. So it's certainly going to be a great time no matter what your music taste. The singers can SING! The band can PLAY! It is quite an impressive Vegas musical. 

If you're looking for a good, concert like show and you're a music fan period, you should check out RoA.",164

Their atmosphere was ok because they're considered how to entertains guests in dining area, but Tables to close together. Service is just depends on the which waiters. Our first waitress was just OK, She's just still strange to the job, but suddenly they're changed to new waiter who is very great service and a knowing fellow.

Overall, the food was only okay. The quality of some of the ingredients seems to have declined since my visit here about a year ago. The fish in the sushi rolls tasted pretty fresh, but the rice seemed a bit dry and old.. this effectively ruined a lot of the specialty rolls for me. The sashimi was very good (especially the salmon and clam), but I wish we had the option to order eel by itself. I also enjoyed the beef tataki. 

The cooked foods were either hit or miss for the most part. The kalbi was pretty good, and we ended up ordering that a few times. It isn't the highest quality short rib, but they do get a nice char on the meat. I also really like their kimchi seafood hot pot. The broth is delicious with just the right amount of spice. The one complaint I have about this is that they put way too much inedible crap in there (like fish tail).. I'd rather have more soup and less of that stuff. The fried pork chop was probably the worst thing we received during dinner. It was thin, tough, and bland.. just about the worst fried pork chop I've had in a long time. I didn't bother eating any more after trying a bite. 

I really like the way they do desserts here. The servings are very small (shotglass size), so you can try a lot of different things. My favorite dessert was the lychee mousse.. I should've ordered 5 of those. All of the desserts I tried were pretty good except for the strawberry ice cream. The strawberry ice cream tasted really artificial (almost like medicine).

The service was just awful. The servers got something wrong pretty much every time we ordered food. We had to order a few items multiple times to receive it once. We had to wait an absurd amount of time to receive the second half of our ramen order. There seems to be something that is causing a lot of miscommunication at some point in the ordering/food preparation/delivery process. They really need to figure out what the root cause is and fix it because it was happening WAY too often in our dinner. Our table also had a lot of issues flagging down servers even when it was getting late and less crowded. Our dinner must've taken about 2.5-3 hours because of how slow they were. The prices were reasonable for AYCE, but I don't know if I would be willing to come back and deal with the service again. 2.5/5",442

I was rolling through the neighbourhood today when their sign (hidden behind a Denny's) caught my eye, in a plaza just near Rutherford and Jane in Vaughan (across from WEGZ).

I popped open Yelp to get a feeling for the place and the reviews really didn't have much positive to say about this spot. Undeterred and looking to build my own opinion about Sparks as a new locally owned business, I pulled in and parked. 

The venue has all sorts of Wow-factors aesthetically from when you first walk in. As only we can do in the 'burbs the ceilings were ultra-high with magnificent light fixtures.The restaurant has that similar open kitchen + clean/sexy design as you'd come to expect from a Moxies/Joeys/Browns Socialhouse (Oakville). But given the location, I think this is a nice spot to add some sophistication to the area.

It was empty when I arrived, save for one table, so I asked to sit at the bar to have a quick drink, order some food and do a bit of work before moving on. Staff were friendly and seated me, before excusing themselves so that they could have the bartender come out and serve.

The cocktail menu and beer list weren't anything special (big brands, no craft/local beer) and a very sugar drink based list of cocktails (mojitos, etc). These kinds of cocktails ""used"" to be the standard but in the midst of a cocktail renaissance across the 416/905 I expected to see the classic cocktail standards on the menu (negroni, old fashioned, manhattan, martini, etc). This would be my main critique and piece of constructive criticism here. 

That said, I DID order an Old Fashioned off-menu and with a little direction (use Bourbon, not Crown Royal) the bartender pulled off a pretty good version. The skill is definitely there, she did great!

For food, I was trying to be healthy, which in Vaughan is difficult with all the Italian and BBQ options everywhere. Sparks seems to have a great signature ethnic dish to cater to many tastes as well as select chop house options. Sticking to my healthy guns I went with the bartender's recommendation of the Kale Krunch salad. Wanting a bit more protein I asked for a chicken breast to be added and for some spice some jerk sauce on the side.

The salad was really great, a solid mix of kale, veggies, crispy wonton style noodles and for the amount you get in the bowl $10.25 was a super reasonable price. The chicken was cooked great as well and the jerk sauce was flavourful with a nice kick but not too hot (for me).

Unfortunately, I had to hit the road and didn't get to enjoy a coffee or dessert option (probably for the best and my diet) but from what I saw I actually enjoyed. It's definitely a great Date Night spot in Vaughan with their many high-backed leather booths. I'll look forward to returning here in the summer when their patio opens, hopefully, I'll get to add that deserved 5th star after trying more of their menu out and seeing some changes to their cocktail + beer menu!

Looking forward to my next visit!

First impression- love the openness and actual light, so much better than the stuffy, dark atmosphere at the Summerlin location! Nice decor, and love plush seating at the bar tables. 
We were dining during Happy Hour to take advantage of our $100 gift card that I won!
Service is quick and friendly, and there was no long wait for anything. We tried a number of happy hour apps- Salt & pepper tempura shrimp (tasty shrimp, but the mustardy sauce it comes with was a no go) Asked for cocktail sauce instead. 
There are also tempura green beans with the shrimp, and tempura lemons which is very strange. I liked the lemons, but who wants to bite into what looks like a slice of zucchini and find a lemon?
The baked brie was my fave. Delicious! Served with apple slices. 
The Fleming's salad was very good, loved the tangy dressing. There are a number of $6 drinks at happy hour, we both enjoyed those as well. Nice selection of $6 wines and 2 beers (their choice) for $6.
I ordered carrot cake to go, which was mushy and seemed not cooked all the way. Last time I had the carrot cake at the Summerlin location, it was delicious!
I would return here to enjoy the outdoor seating area!",225

We ordered Mirzaghasemi  and Vaziri (chicken bbq and koobideh) which are of my favourite Persian foods. The Mirzaghasemi tasted like dog puke mixed with garlic. absolutely disgusting taste. funny enough the table next to us were complaining about their food as well. After waiting for half an hour we got the bbq and first thing we noticed was a hair sticking to our bbq. beyond gross but we didn't want to ruin our night so we just picked it out and tried to forget it ever happened. The bbq was completely uncooked inside but the outside was burnt burnt!! we asked them to cook it some more as the Koobideh was super rare!! after the bbq it some we tried it. this was literally the single most disgusting taste koobideh I ever had in my life. I could still feel the terrible taste in my nightmares!! the saffron chicken bbq was cooked ok but the taste was so bad!!! extremely sour and salty and dry beyond imagination!! 
before I forget I want to comment on their rice!! they use a super cheap smelly rice that has a horrible after taste!! it's a cheap brand you can find in Persian store!! It's called gold or yellow rice if I'm not mistaken!! it's was like chewing gums!! 
bottom line is do not go to this place unless you're prepared to waste your time, money and appetite there.",286

Service was very nice. We were given water upon arrival and were check on couple of times before we decided what we wanted and during our meal. The server was patient explaining us the menu. A nice touch would have been if she introduced herself. We were sitting outside (must have been the last nice day of the season) so I don't know what is the atmosphere like inside.  
We both ordered a plate of lamb chops with soup as entrÃ©e. We got our bread basket with butter first. 
Bread had nice consistency and was fressh. Butter was ready to be spread on and did not come straight from the fridge.
Soup was carrot and was nice and hearty. I especially liked that the plates were warmed up.
Next arrived our salad. It was simple salad - lettuce, onions and olives with olive oil. Onions were tasty and olive oil tasted like olive oil (not always the case!). Both of of our mains were done as we requested. Well done and medium. The meat was very tasty and tender but the meat part could have been bigger. Chops looked more like medallions on the plate. It came with a side of house chips that I am not a big fan of but my counterpart enjoyed it. We also shared 1/2 l of red house wine that went down nicely with the lamb. The bill came to $80 for both which is reasonable for the meal and service we received. I would definitely go back and try something else on the menu.",266

Having now been here numerous times, I've yet to have an experience that I wouldn't call anything less than good. On my most recent dining experience, my date and I were looking for dessert only. The dessert selection was quite vast, but we both chose a mini trio of desserts, which included a mini cheesecake, lava cake, and panna cotta. We paired our dessert with one of their many dessert wines. Service was good but we did run into an issue with the gift card. Apparently, they recently switched vendors and the balance was showing up as $0 when it actually was $50. The manager took a look online and verified the correct amount and gave us the remaining balance on a huge paper certificate. Sonoma Grille is under the same ownership of Perle (in Market Square). I'll add that we had the same issue with the same gift card at Perle, but they did not look online and, instead, we were forced to pay cash that night.",186

The temperature situation seems to have improved. I ate there the other day. Like, on site.

The best kept secret in the man-world: the women who work and dine here  are so bloody hot. If you're a straight male human, lonely, longing for the touch of a beautiful woman, eat here. Everyday. You're bound to get lucky, at the very least because positive karma will be catching up with you for not supporting any of the evil industries. 

Original review: 

I love this place. I went twice yesterday. I seriously cannot get enough. As a transitioning vegetarian/vegan, the food here is a dream come true. Everything I've had is amazing. Very tasty. The chocolate and organic peanut butter tsoynami is the best dessert I think I've ever had, vegan or not. But what the fuck is up with the temperature in that place? Vegans like a temperate place to eat as much as anyone. I can't eat in there. It's so hot. I have to get my food to go or only eat there in the winter. I just don't get it. Aren't the employees uncomfortable? How could I be the only one this bothers? That's a wrap is similarly uncomfortable, but more tolerable. All that complaining aside, I cannot recommend this place enough for the food. It's, quite frankly, delicious.",230

Saw Flosstradamus  here last night.  Great sound. Great show. Some useful feedback:
- I wish their website had different language regarding the dress code.  Don't get me wrong EVERYBODY dressed to impress... But dress shoes to a floss concert?!!  I blew it there.  Better safe than sorry made my feet sorry today. Can we get the website updated? Also - it's hot in there. Can I wear a nice T? I still don't know.  Website should be updated.  
- Club layout was weird. Seemed like too many VIP sections in the middle areas of the pit.  That led to people being shoveled left or right and a really bad flow. Seems like it can be fixed pretty easily by just relocating one or 2 poorly placed VIP sections. Lots of bumping if you wanted to dance in the pit.  Otherwise tons of room and comfort if you want to hang by the pool or back bar.

Overall this is a really cool place and will be back.  May have had expectations set too high by hitting up encore beach club first. Remove a couple temporary ropes and will be flawless.

It's one of the few places in Toronto that serve sushi a la cart instead of AYCE. That being said and factoring in the quality of sushi in Toronto, this place barely met my expectations.

I had a Chirashi bowl, some salmon sashimi and some tuna maki. The plating was a bit lacking, as it was just simply sushi on a white glass plate. In general, the fish was as I expected it to be for sushi in Toronto; not that fresh, and hence lacking flavour. On top of that, the sashimi I had was not well sliced; I found a couple of bones and what looked like a scale in my sashimi, which was a bit disappointing. The rice was satisfactory as well; I felt like there wasn't enough vinegar in the rice to complement the fish.

Overall, it was an average meal. It was convenient and fairly inexpensive, but I wouldn't recommend going out of your way to go to this place for sushi alone. (There's also teppanyaki, which I'd try if I were to return for another meal.)",187

The price was great (169/night) with a package that included $40 off the Phantom of the Opera show tickets! We were definitely planning on seeing it, so it was perfect! There were other discounts in the package (to an Asian restaurant and a Mexican one at Palazzo) but we didn't use those. 

The Venetian...OMG, I loved that place! The perfume scent that others complain about in their reviews, actually wasn't bad...I was worried about it, being highly allergic to strong smelling perfumes, but it was actually really nice...I even miss it now...I didn't sneeze at all from it. We arrived early, 2pm, and they checked is in no problem (3pm is checkin)...Our room was very-very nice, my hubby's jaw sort of dropped when he first saw the room (I booked the whole thing so I already saw the pictures). It was very spacious, from the bathroom to the bedroom/living room...3 TVs in the place! I subtracted a star though b/c our TV in the bathroom did not work :( I was bummed b/c being a woman I spend a LOTTA time in there :) 

The pool area on the 4th floor was very nice (there's another pool with more shade and more privacy on the 10th floor too)...I didn't check out Tao Beach, because I didnt even realize that was in a different area until later. My hubby walked by it and said it was nothing major, so I believed him. There were sufficient chairs at the pool, and the waitresses came by occasionally to see if anyone needed drinks. They could've made more money personally if they came by more frequently. Drinks were good, and the restaurant (Riva by Wolfgang Puck) has really good lunch menu (Pizza was great, and their salads too). 

Overall, next time I'm in Vegas I will definitely stay at the Venetian.",326

2016 Yelp 100 Review Challenge -     12/100


I've heard about this park from family and friends over the years, but didn't experience it myself till sometime last year. After that, I began coming here for my morning cardio (walk/run/hike) several days a week. 

I agree with many of the reviews for this park. It has a little bit of everything and more. 

- A bad ass playground I wish existed during my childhood. 

- A huge grassy area for picnics, soccer, and just laying out to relax, read a good book, write or draw. I've seen some photographers do their photo sessions here. 

- There is a path way to a small mountain, great for a short hike. 

   It's a great hike if you want to do a solo hike in the morning. Every morning that I've been here there were others hiking the trail, doing their morning cardio/workouts as well. So I felt safe knowing that there were others around if I accidentally fell or what not. 

- There is no cement trail up and down the mountain.  It's just dirt and gravel. So be careful.

- There are different pathways up and down the hill for the adventurous souls. (Not recommended for beginners. Check out the trail first before you go exploring :-) ) 

- There are two levels up the mountain. So you can rest at the 1st level. It has a shaded picnic table and a great view of the city. 

- At the top, there's a huge platform with an amazing view of the city. With a little bit of Nevada history. It's peaceful at the top. And reminds me why I love nature and this city. 

- Some people do their Tai Chi and/or meditation in the morning. Either at the top of the mountain or in the park.  It's peaceful to watch. 

- There's a small cement stage at the other end of the park. I'm guessing for plays and performances during the warmer months. 

- Bathrooms are clean and stocked every morning. 

- Great park to bring your doggies and fur buddies as well. 

*** Tip: If you don't live in Mountain's Edge & you're coming from I-15/Blue Diamond or 215/Buffalo, it's on Buffalo road & you'll have to make a U-turn to get to the entrance of this park.",435

I was not disappointed! My goodness the service is excellent and friendly (at least the dude that helped me). 

I got the jerk chicken burrito with chow mein instead of rice with all the toppings, including guac and edamame.  So good! It was filling, the jerk chicken isn't the best jerk I've had but it was still  tasty. 

The Mexican cola I got was also out of this world.. Lots of cane sugar but always nice to treat yo'self. 

There is not much seating. I think for two St the window. It's mainly a take out spot and very small inside. I recommend preparing to take the food elsewhere to a bench! 

Would definitely go back and try the general tao chicken burrito. Heck even the vegan burrito sounds delicious from the menu. 

Just go!",159

I have always been an aficionado of real Mexican food. In North America we are invariably offered ""Mexican food"" which is nothing but....

This is a gem of place in one of the 'satellites' of Vaughan Mills. You are initially greeted by a simple Mexican decor that is not overdone.

The menu is varied but not overwhelming. They do not try to be everything to everybody, but their offerings are interesting and HOME MADE. This includes the salsa bar where a variety of salsas in varying degrees of heat are presented. The only slight reservation that I had about this place is that they use a lot of flour tortillas. Corn would be a whole lot better.

I began my lunch with a Sopa Azteca. This rich soup is tomato and chili based and provides a thick warm and full blown taste. It contains Tortillas strips, avocado and cheese and has been thickened with sour cream and sprinkled with a bit of queso. It was totally delicious. The ladies shared a Sopa de Frijoles (Black bean soup), which was much easier on the tomato but had a nice lightly spiced taste.

I then ordered an Enchilada de Mole Poblano which consists of 3 well sized enchiladas in a Mole (Sauce) of Poblano peppers finished with Chocolate. This is served with Rice and black beans. The sauce is absolutely terrific and would not be out of place in a ""name"" restaurant. It is that awesome. You can have this dish as a vegetarian dish, but I chose to have it with chicken. I was keeping as close to tradition as possible since chocolate mole is usually served for festive occasions with turkey.

The ladies shared the classic quesadillas which extremely good and then shared a carnitas burrito. Now that was a burrito....not the designer items that pass in other restaurants for Burritos. The salsas complemented all our meals which was accompanied by Sol Beer. Unfortunately we all were too full for dessert.

I was so sure that this restaurant would feature Menudo (my favorite Mexican soup/meal), and it does! It is made for special occasion and is featured on their web site. I will be going there again soon. 

Throw off your corporate restaurant Mexican food blahs and treat yourself to the real thing!",402

Here's why we have become regular customers: 

The food: Definitely try the torta--the bread is crispy and well-proportioned to the fillings, which are beautifully balanced in texture and quantity. On the side are perfectly pickled, crisp vegetables (escabeche). Another must-try is the Mexican street corn. Though the chefs sometimes overdo it on the aioli, this dish is the perfect blend of sweet, salty, spicy, and tart. And the tacos? YUM. My favorite is carnitas, which comes topped with a sweet and spicy mango habanero sauce. We're also addicted to the nicely-spiced duritos--or wagon wheels--that you get for free with your meal. We always order a second bag. 

The drinks: Canteen's strawberry margarita is one of my favorite drinks in town. It is sweet, but well-balanced, and the hibiscus and chartreuse give it a really unique flavor. Another favorite is the pistolero: smokey and citrusy, tiny and strong. We love Canteen's happy hour, which is every day (!) from 2pm-5pm. Half-priced strawberry margaritas? Yes, please. 

The environment: It's cozy, intimate, warm, and bright, with beautiful & colorful Mexican decor. The music is festive, yet not obtrusive. We can spend hours here! 

The service: We love the food and the drinks here, but the staff is what keeps us coming back every week. (Yes, every week.) Everybody is so friendly, generous, and helpful, and they truly seem to like where they work. Thank you Ally, Leah, Lyle, and the rest of the staff at Canteen for making every visit a great one!",273

We were so blown away by all the things we ordered... I'm at a loss of words and where to begin... let's start with what we ordered:

So, they were out of brisket by the time we got there but no biggie we had plenty of other options to try.

Tacos - 2 Pulled Chicken + 1 Pulled Pork - 5/5
Cuban Sandwich - 5/5
Sliders (combo-fied) - 5/5
1/2 LB Smoked Sausage Links - 4.5/5
Chili Bowl - 4/5
Mexicorn - 3/5
Potato Salad - 5/5

So tacos... amazing mouthgasm.  Get it.  It had such depth of flavor and the portions were huge.  Meat to tortilla ratio was very worth.  I had originally cringed at the 10 buck price tag (that's the Asian in me), but I would pay more for these babies after eating them.  Comes with Pico, a Roja sauce, and some lettuce.  Bomb diggity.

Next is the cubano... it had their smoked pulled pork and I must say it was delicious.  The price to portion ratio was a little bit not as worth but flavor wise it was on point.

Sliders were amazing with the nice thick, can I even call it mini patties.  Add on the in house pickles were so tasty and I'm not even a pickle fan.  This was extremely worth and the shoestring fries were so tasty it was awesome.

Now the smoked sausage links were really yummy and for 1/2 a pound it seemed like we got more than we were expecting.  I would suggest to get 1/2 lb for a family of 3-4.  The price per pound was on the pricier side and really I felt like this was a nice side to all the other things we ordered, thus the rating.  It was a nice sidekick, not really the star of this review (see tacos).

Chili Bowl was good and hearty but maybe it was because I just made some bomb Texas chili the other day, but I felt like I did a better job or maybe I was chilied out but yes, solid chili... not amazing I gotta get this again chili.

Now yelpers I really have to call you guys out on the Mexicorn.  It looked like the pictures, but tasted just okay to me.  It needed more sauce/creamy/cheesiness, but just more.  I was disappointed by this side more so because I was so hyped up on it by y'all.

My babe is really into potato salad so we got some.  It was good, and I personally would not have gotten it if he wasn't there with me.  But yea it was yummy and the baby liked it too.

I gotta put in a word about the different BBQ sauces.  I must say every one of them was solid A++ especially Toto's and the Memphis one (I can't recall the exact name) I would buy the sauce by itself if they sold it.

Next time we will have to try the brisket stack and come back soon.  I'm craving it just writing this review haha.  Tom's thumb is doing something right folks... it's definitely worth the drive for.",558

I didn't realize how good I had it at the ABC store on Harris Blvd in University. Most trips there was hardly a line, and if it was it went quickly. 

On my first Friday night trip, the line went all the way to the back wall. Initially, I asked myself if i REALLY needed a bottle of liquor to get me through the evening. I thought about the minuscule amount of vodka in the pantry, and decided to stay. Perhaps if there were 3 registers open instead of two the line wouldn't have been that long.

The characters were out in full force this night. Some people a little loud, and one person even knocked over a bottle of liquor by accident. By the time I reached the front of the line almost a half hour later, the line went around the store and almost to the door.

I do appreciate the selection, I've been to many of the ABC stores around town, and from the ones I've seen, only the Matthews (or maybe it's the Indian Trail) store on Independence and the store down the block from UNCC have a wider selection.

Just get here early!",216

To come away from the classes with an actual tool to use is refreshing and provides so much  clarity. 

I've recently gone through a several major milestones - divorce, job loss, relocating to a new state and separation from family.  I've laid out a new path and my blueprint gives me tools to acknowledge this is the right path.   The team is very supportive while also challenging me to address any lingering issues.  

They helped me open up to receive the messages I needed to hear to make this change in my life.   What a blessing!

So my in laws wanted us to check out City Barbeque since they eat at this location often. Off we went, City Barbeque is located in a big shopping center, easy to spot frm the main road, has a big parking lot, the place was mostly empty when we got there.

My father in law couldn't take advantage of their rewards program (as a regular customer), it didn't work well, so he couldn't use a coupon they promised. That's always a bummer. Maybe they should have been more helpful and also make the program simpler.

We got pulled pork sandwiches, which where good, slaw, hush puppies (very good, my favorite part of the meal) and mac and cheese (just OK).

 The issue with this place is that even if it's a restaurant, you kinda have to do it all yourself. Get your plates, utensils, sauces (they have a station further from tables). I did enjoy my Carolina mustard sauce, open your beer bottle - got the local brew- Olde Mecklenburg - Amber Ale. We were told to go to some area to open the bottles, had a hard time finding the opener. They can't even open a beer bottle for you, here? At the table with sauces for BBQ  they had another station - with pickles, onion, etc. I really liked their pickles, got my fix, nice and sour.

Customer service was sloppy, they didn't seem to care or be helpful. Same in the restrooms- the ladies one didn't have toilet paper, the men's restroom didn't have paper towels.

The food is OK, but this place should improve their customer service and put less on the customers. It's too hands off for my taste and I'm not a diva!",304

Pros: 
- By far the CLEANEST day club
- Good service
- Spacious
- Good food

Cons: 
- Um...none?

In A Nutshell: 

Encore Beach Club is by far the best day club that I've been to, although this is subjective (e.g. I highly dislike Marquee, therefore I automatically assume their day club sucks).  

First off, EBC is CLEAN. By the end of the day, the water is still clear and there are no cups, bottles, straws, crap, etc. floating around in the water.  The restroom floors are constantly being mopped and dried for those of you who like walking around barefoot (GROSS, but I digress).  

EBC also has a lot of space for people to roam and sit, especially those who don't order table service.  Wonderful, considering most clubs today make your life miserable if you don't happen to want to shell out $10,000 for a table.  The pool is also large enough to accommodate many people, making it easy maneuver through and to duck out of the way in case anyone wants to play chicken (which security won't let happen, but you never know...it's Vegas!).

Lastly, when you're drunk and starving, they have a bar area that serves great food.  Get the chicken fingers with waffle fries.  After 16 drinks, it's the best thing you'll ever eat.

GO. TO. EBC. Buy presales online and get in line early.  Doors typically open at 11am and run until 6pm.",263

It's cheap, but the food part is nearly non-existent. Must just have a menu for ""show"" or because of liquor laws that they must have food.

The few patrons were riled up because their food orders were not being filled, even HOURS after they had ordered (and pre-paid).

And yes, it seemed the sole ""cook"" running the frylator and the bartender were drunk, and totally distracted on their cellphones.

It is BEYOND HORRIBLE, even if the drinks are cheap -- I'm sure about 100 health code violations, nasty drunks, dirty, awful food, non-existent service, sticky tables and floors. Also it was FREEZING COLD.

Weird, because Coventry is a laid back area of grad students and young professionals -- and there are plenty of nice bars and hangouts, including a WInking Lizard just steps away (which were all PACKED on V-day).

We had a coupon from Restaurant.com, and never heard of this place, and stupidly thought it was an actual pub. NOT.

Avoid, AVOID...AVOID. Also, I am pretty sure this pathetic place is in the last stages before just closing down entirely, from lack of business or health code violations.",275

And she received a recommendation to try out Yardbird. None of us had heard of it before, but we decided to give it a go.

-Chicken 'n' Watermelon 'n' Waffles, along with:
-Classic Buttermilk Biscuits
-Deviled Eggs
-Fried Green Tomato BLT 

Let's start with the deviled eggs. I'm a big fan of them, and actually make them myself from time to time. But theirs were pretty good I must say. The fried green tomato BLT was delicious too. I think it was the pork belly that set it off. It's just something about swine that makes everything taste better. â€�

But that buttermilk biscuit though? With the butter and jam on it! Mannnn, please! Yummy in my tummy, okayyyy!! Oooooh, it was so good, I wanted to order more, but I was trying to watch my carbs . The chicken was juicy and seasoned to perfection, and the watermelon was sweet and the waffles were fluffy and tasty.

To wash it down, I ordered a Blackberry Bourbon Lemonade. Let me tell you something... I'm not a big bourbon drinker, but this drink was good. If you're also a non-bourbon drinker, but you like a bit of sweetness, then you should definitely try it.

Overall, very good food, the service was acceptable, and the decor had a lounge feel, with comfortable couch seating, which I like. I'm definitely going to revisit them, and now they have a location in L.A., so that's absolutely, positively wonderful!",295

F**K !!!! Sorry, I'm not prone to using profanity, but that's how upset I am that today was my first visit to Stinkweeds.  I have wasted countless hours surfing iTunes listening to 20 second clips of music, when I simply needed to walk into Stinkweeds and say, ""Hi, tell me about some cool music.""  I am completely outsourcing my music shopping to the staff of this store.  Let me tell you about my first time.  I walked in the door. I am sure I looked disoriented.  I had not been inside a true record store in years.  The fact that the shelves were filled with an overwhelmingly large number of albums with unrecognizable band names amplified my disorientation.  A member of the staff approached me. ""Do you need help?""  I hesitated, thinking to myself, I am so not cool,  I am about to be exposed.  I must have nodded in the affirmative because he quickly followed up with  ""What kind of music do you like?""  This is the most perilous question to be asked by a record store guy. Visions of High Fidelity flashing through my mind, I mumbled, ""Uh, I don't know.""   ""Yes, you do.  Tell me.""  I managed to rattle off the names of a few non-mainstream bands that I actually really love.  I waited for a respond.  ""Cool.  Let me play you something.""  He proceeded to switch the music being played in the store to his pick for me.  Within minutes I was sold.  We repeated this process until I had selected 3 absolutely amazing albums that I would have never found on my own.  After wandering around the store for a while on my own, admiring the wide selection of stellar music, I decided it was time to pay and get on with my day.  Record store guy paused a moment before ringing up my purchase.  ""Wait a second, I think we have used copies of all 3 of these albums. I'm going to save you some money.""  Sure enough, after some searching, he returned with the promised goods.  Total price for 3 amazingly good albums?  $24 including tax.  I'm hooked.  Awesome music selection, friendly non-threatening staff (yes, I know that's redundant), lots of used CDs...  you know where to find me next weekend.",415

Every time I walk in here, I am always overwhelmed by how HUGE this place is.  There's a cafe in the middle.  A CAFE.  Where there are beverages and food.  So if you get too tired from walking or just plain lost, go right on to the middle and find this little oasis to recharge.

Prices aren't too bad, but you can almost always get it cheaper online.  The sections are well-organized and I usually do not have any problems finding anything.  I've also built my own computer and work for a tech-related startup, so I know what a lot of the signs are pointing to.

The line can be super annoying!  They usually get people through pretty fast at least.

Another downer is sometimes the sales associates can be aggressive as it seems that they get a percentage of the sale.

I recently went to pick up some items for my boss and an associate sort of scooped me up so I could find them faster than I already did (saved me ~10 seconds).  Then she asked if she could tally my basket under her name so she gets credit or something to that effect.

My trade-off?  ""Sure, if I can get to the front of the line.""  That worked pretty well that day, but I can't promise it'll work for you.

Fun to browse as long as you don't get heckled by the workers.  ""No, I don't need help, thank you"" and stern eye contact works most of the time for me.",297

It would be great if they supplied free laundry soap and dryer sheets as a courtesy since they are charging you for using the machines. As for the room, it was decent and a Kurig machine is provided with a mini fridge and microwave, but the sugar at the coffee station seemed old and stuck together. The house cleaning staff  did not supply much splenda in the rooms and I ran out after the first night. They also did a mediocre job with cleaning the rooms and left used glassware. Overall, my experience was not bad. The kitchen menu offers smoothies, which I thought was great! However, I did order fried eggs with potatoes on one occasion and the meal came out with bacon and toast. Being a vegetarian I asked for a new dish without bacon, and I could tell they only took the bacon off the plate. The meal tasted and smelled like bacon grease. Pretty lousy.

He was polite and patient in trying to hear back from me, so that he could re-open my file and see where the mistake was.
We figured out that the original discrepancy was due to a missing T4E slip, since I was on Mat Leave.  To this day, it is still a mystery as to where that form is.  
We only discussed my file.

Take my review with a grain of salt.  It was only my experience with this company.  This happened last year (for 2014 taxes).  I am pretty sure that we mentioned that I was on Mat Leave, since we did to the other company we had taxes done with the last time I was on Mat Leave.  I didn't remember about a T4E form, this time around.  It is possible that I didn't receive one from the government in 2015.  I could have requested it directly, if I knew it was one of the documents needed.  I collected all the other pieces of information, slips, that were brought to my attention from Triple M. 

This year, I went to another service, that electronically accessed our slips from the government.  If you choose Triple M, perhaps you can request that as well.  So that any issues can be avoided.",238

The server was very nice and willing to answer all the questions we had. We decided on the option where the chef chooses different entrees for the table because the menu was very confusing. We were told it would be $40-$50/person. That's where the problems began. It was not explained to us that we were being charged for each individual item, but were under the impression that it would just be a bundle price. We did get to try some great things and all of us got our fill, but the waiter came back and said he wanted us to try his favorite item and then would end us with a bowl of miso. None of us really wanted anything extra, but like I said before, we thought it was a bundle deal. When we received our check, it was itemized out for everything and the last thing, miso, (which only 3 of the 4 people had) was $9 a piece. This was kind of a slap in the face after a very enjoyable meal. Also, instead of it being $40-$50/person, it was actually $65-$75/person. Of course that is only for the food, not including any drinks.

I believe the option we chose could have been explained a lot better and I would be willing to recommend this place to others. After getting left with this bad taste, I would not do so. Beware of the deceit.",250

My first visit, I ordered the Yuzu-ade. I've tried Yuzu with hot water before and thought it tasted really yummy, but the product here it tasted like yuzu lemon water - it took a while to drink all of it because it really just wasn't that good haha my second visit - I ordered a hot pistachio latte and that it was okay - how it should taste; it taste like Serenade's at Rainbow Blvd so which is closer and that's what you're craving, just go to that one. 

Bun got the Pink-Lychee Ade? It tasted better than my Yuzu-ade but quoting Bun, it was similar to it lol... second visit: he ordered the Green Tea Frappe and that was yummy in my opinion - more sweeter than normal but nothing overwhelming and would keep you wanting more I think. Perhaps I'll get this next time.

I'll come back but it won't be consistent. I thought the decor was cute but after a while... it appears like a play-house, a little childish/immature like.

Oh, beware of the annoying high school couple who may take up the couch when you enter and it's on your right - this place is open until 3am so everrrybody might be coming.

Oh last but not least, save your $1 on the macarons. It's taken out from the  refrigerator / freezer so it comes out hard.",260

We waited about 25 minutes, but really wanted to try it. The staff was friendly and helpful.
It was definitely pricey ($50 for breakfast), but the portions are HUGE!  My hubby got the flapjack and it was the size of a monster truck tire...he can put away some food and was only able to eat half of it. I got their famous fried chicken and it had a maple reduction on it that I could have done without. The biscuit was big and came with a delicious blueberry preserve. Now, for my favorite part of the meal..the griddle cooked mashed potatoes were hands down the best I've ever had!!!!  Even after I felt like I was gonna need wheeled out on a gurney from eating to much, I ate some more of those mashed potatoes!  They were chunky red potatoes seasoned perfectly then put on a hot griddle to get a nice crust on the outside. Absolutely brilliant. 
I had the strawberry lemonade. It was good, but I expected more from $5 a glass and $1 for refills. My husband got a mint cappuccino and raved about it. I asked to substitute my bacon for chicken sausage and the waitress came back to me and said the chef said no...which was annoying but not a huge deal.  All in all, very good food and big portions. We left overstuffed, and needing to sleep off a food coma. We also left with empty pockets, so we will save going back for special occasions.",270

If you want fresh seafood, this is the place to go whether for their sandwiches or tacos or  fish and chips or chowder. The menu is small, but nothing wrong with that as you know what their specialities are in a few visits.

Prices may seem a little steep for a sandwich, but for what you're getting it's worth the price for the freshness and the taste.  I had the lobster roll  ($13.95) which was absolutely delicious with big chunks of lobster coated lightly with dressing on a soft warm bread roll.  Came with fries which were cooked to a nice crisp and a broccoli slaw that was lightly dressed and refreshing.

My friend ordered the soft shelled crab sandwich ($15.95) and wasn't disappointed.  Lightly battered and full of flavour, plus presentation was great, almost too pretty to eat.

I will definitely have to come back to try the other menu items and fact that it's a small menu,  I can easily try them all in less visits than some other places that boasts a large selection.

Note:  If you like Sriracha, there is no shortage here as there's a whole display of it at the back by the kitchen.",221

I was greeted at the front by Eric with a huge smile and it immediately put me at ease. My pedicure was amazing ... the first one I've ever had that wasn't rushed and I truly felt like I got my money's worth. Let's be honest, I get pedicures bc I want to be pampered .. Eric also did my pedicure but first he made sure I was comfortable in the chair, showed me how to start the massager on the chair, made sure my purse was hung up and I was all settled before he started. My daughter was next to me and even though she is only 13 her technician also treated her like a princess (I've found other places treat her like a child and rush through her services) after getting our awesome pedicures I decided to stay and get a fill for my nails and a manicure for my daughter. Now let me be honest again when I say I'm SUPER picky about my nails. I didn't have an appointment for nails but they quickly accommodated my daughter and I. My nails were messed up from another salon and had bubbles underneath them. Connie took her time (a longggg time) to correct them. She was patient, professional, and was determined to make sure I left happy with basically brand new nails. This is not a salon where they seem bothered by you, talk about you to other techs or try to talk you out of what you want bc they don't feel like doing it. It felt so good to be somewhere so professional and welcoming. Mind you it was a busy Saturday afternoon and they STILL took their time. My daughters manicure was also great her nails look wonderful. I found my new salon :) and I'll be telling everyone I know about it. Also, the prices are great! We will be back:)",345

The owner and primary teacher Elle is knowledgeable in all things yoga and pilates. An experienced teacher (and Doula), you can always rest assured that you will either come in and break a sweat or stretch out those muscles to total relaxation - or both! 

Many different classes are offered including Hatha Yoga for beginners, Ball Pilates, and Mom & Babe Yoga. 

The last round of classes I took in the new studio located at Balance Integrated Health was the Mom & Babe yoga/pilates fusion and the classes are split between knowledge sharing about experiences in pregnancy and a good workout for the pregnant mom. 

The studio itself is intimate and allows a smaller class size which means more one on one attention to make sure that you're getting every move right - something that larger gyms tend to miss with their class sizes. As well, if you're not into toting around all of your yoga gear, the studio happily supplies mats and balls for your personal use. 

But the best part: once you're done with your workout you're steps away from Balance Integrated Health where you can finish your day off with a relaxing massage...or even better with a cupcake from For The Love of Cake. 

What can I say I'm counter productive.",256

The food here is passable; not horrible since they have the same recipe as all other Burger Kings, but not particularly good either. The service though is seriously a problem.

Never have I ever seen staff as unsociable, rude, and unaccommodating as the ones here. It's a dingy restaurant with dim lighting and an old looking interior, so of course I didn't walk in expecting fine dining-level customer service. However, just from a short interaction at the cash register, the staff here (and not just one member but multiple staff members) clearly demonstrated to me how much they hated their lives and didn't give a single shit about their customers.

I asked about something, they said they didn't have it; no problem, I understand that things happen. But did they offer alternatives or even a meaningless ""sorry for the inconvenience""? No. The staff here have a serious attitude problem; they don't just lack proper customer service skills, they lack basic manners. That of course is more than enough to convince me never to come back to this location again. There's a reason why this place was completely empty on a Saturday afternoon.",212

Their tacos are ridiculously small, and they are way over priced! $3 for a smaller than a mini-taco, taco? No thanks. Maybe I'll give them another shot and try a burrito instead.

The salsa's are ""okay"". The bean soup/frijoles charros was my favorite part of my meal, they have pork in them, and the broth has good consistency.

It is hidden away in an office park and has lots of parking. Both inside the restaurant and the outdoor seating looked very nice, but since it was a nice day we sat outside. I loved sitting on the couch area with lots of pillows. Our waiter was very nice and patient with us (we were very indecisive with our food!) and gave us good recommendations when we asked. 

I tried the chicken dish and it was probably the best chicken ever! It was so tasty and fell apart so easily so it was easy to pickup. There was also some sort of macaroni and cheese sorta dish, which was okay. I wasn't too crazy about the macaroni and cheese though the chicken changed my life! After our lunch, we had three cheeses which were extremely yummy as well.

Overall, the service was great (I never had an empty glass), the food was amazing (everyone at the table enjoyed their meals and had leftovers to bring home), and ambiance was relaxing. I definitely would like to return on my next trip back to Vegas.

The courses: Deviled Egg with Pimento Cheese, Tempura Whole Baby Turnips with Sweet Chili Sauce, Beet Tartar with Beet Sponge Cake, Florida Shrimp with Black Rice, Baby Bok Choy, and Shitake Mushrooms, Gulf Oyster with Black Eyed Peas, Ham and Hot Sauce, Duck Breast with Sunchoke Puree, Brussel Sprouts and Fig Glaze. 

Dessert courses: Chocolate Mousse Hybrid with powdered Peanut Butter, Chocolate Explosion Truffle layered with Powdered Cocoas.

 Every course was delicious, well thought out and executed. The plating was the really exciting part. Each dish was like a beautiful painting. The Tempura, Seafood and Dessert courses especially stood out for me.

Our servers: Incredible.  Genuine. Knowledgeable. Highly attentive. Friendly. The sheer number of plates and silverware they turned over was impressive.

The ingredients: Locally sourced. Seasonal. Utilized in both a functional, ""dish constructing"" way while simultaneously highlighting each ingredient's flavor. The results are complex synergistic dishes.

The Chef: Chef Paul is just plain great! He is passionate about his ingredients and transforming them in distinct ways. A real artist with some amazing molecular gastronomy techniques.

The finale: Smiles all around. Warm hugs, handshakes and goodbyes.

The summary:  Worth the trip to Waxhaw. The real deal. Five star food and service. Experience it for yourself!",264

We get the strip & fries meal. The chicken strips are succulent and well seasoned, the fries are cut on-location and still have the skin. They can tend to be a bit greasy - but I love them never-the-less. They also have one of those fancy coke machines where you can create your own concoction....holy yum. 

They've got a good blueberry coleslaw, and I've had a couple of their salads before - they never disappoint. After running around on a Sunday morning, this is the perfect place to nourish oneself. They've even got some pretty amazing shakes for when you treat yo'self. :)",174

It was really well decorated, but I found the large mural of a Beijing opera singer staring at you to be a little weird.   

As for customer service, I really don't like being pressured to order things that I might not like to eat.  I think it is normal to upsell your products, but being pressured to order more was the last thing that I wanted when I am eating out.  They may think that this is good service, but for me, this is borderline poor service.  Well, maybe this is how this restaurant considered to be good customer service to breath down the customers' necks and tried to coerce them to order more.   

The highly recommended baos really lack in amount of meat, flavours and fluffiness.  I have tasted many baos in my life before and I usually loved the ones that are fresh and fluffy.  However, the bao offered by this restaurant for $2.10 each was gummy, soggy, and the outside was covered with spots of watermark.    I was glad that each of us at the table only ordered one bun per person.  The sesame oil peanut butter chicken with noodles was good with bold flavour.  The lamb with cumins was just bad news as I didn't really taste any lamb flavour and the cumin flavours were not strong at all.  I think the cumin maybe stale as it was so mild that I barely tasted any cumin flavour.  The bao and the lamb were both a big disappointment.  One of the waiters or maybe he is the manager was extremely impolite as he was banging on the table every time he refill the tea for our table.  I rather him not come by if he cannot even put the teapot onto the table properly.  I simply wouldn't come back to this restaurant as the price was steep, food was not okay, and poor customer service.   We each ended up paying $45 for 3 small baos and 2 dishes.",364

Went there last night for the fish fry and I was VERY impressed. This ranks right up there with the best fish fry joints in Madison. The regular beer battered cod was just the right amount of crisp on the outside with a nice flaky interior, super fresh. Coleslaw was a revelation with a simple sesame dressing instead of a heavy mayonnaise based sauce - it cut right through the richness of the rest of the food. Tartar sauce was awesome as well (with possibly some blue cheese blended in?). And there's nothing else I can say about the fries other then pure perfection. The portions were very large, so for the first time in a while I ended up taking some food home to go - I don't normally do that at restaurants anymore.

Beer selection is fantastic, if not a tad pricier than say Dexter's. Service was excellent as well. I was having a hard time picking a beer from their massive selection and the waiter recommended one that worked out really nice with the meal. He was more than happy to pour small samples of beer (no cost) to help us decide on one. There were some times when the waiters were kind of scrambling around, but this is not unusual for such a new restaurant. Still, I never felt like I was being ignored and the service was fast.

Oh and don't forget to order same appetizers, their ""Dutch Bitterballen"" were incredible with the curry ketchup. Sounds odd? Trust me, they're not. Head on over and check them out for yourself. You won't be disappointed.",291

When the hell did have less of something cost more...OK on that portion it said in small as print that no ice is 50 cent extra so OK our mistake...but still that is really terrible how she didn't give us that kind of courtesy to let us know...another thing was that they charged us 15 % gratuity on our meal and she asked his if I wanted to put my tip on the card...they already charged me and she did not mention that smit was already on the bill she just wanted me to tip her more lol for what bringing my order wrong and coming by what never to check to see if we needed anything? So I asked her u guys already charged us for 15 % gratuity and she was like yea I asked if u would like to put additional tip on ur card like it was suppose to be normal....us she serious? After we got charge 15% for a party of 5 and being waited on with such poor service she expects more tip?

I couldn't believe it.

Is it real? Do my eyes deceive me? IS THAT BOBA? In North Carolina??? 

Without a second to waste, I dragged my coworker like a rag doll inside the brightly lit parlor that was decorated with velvet couches, plushy chairs, twinkling lights, and large, decorative lamps hanging from above. With contemporary music blasting through the sound system, it was almost as if I was back in the Bay Area on a typical boba run with my darling hubby.

The black menu showcased various fruit teas, bubble teas (smoothies), milk teas, and hot drinks. My eyes, however, instantly locked on the milk tea section, spotting my favorite, green milk tea. I eagerly ordered that with grass jelly while my coworker got a strawberry bubble tea with pearls. 

But my eagerness faltered just a bit when I caught a glance of my boba that was...green?

I don't remember green milk tea being green (ironic, now that I think about it). I hesitantly popped the lid and took a small sip before the familiar taste of matcha hit my tongue. While I understand why this would be called green milk tea, I can't say that I didn't feel somewhat tricked...It wasn't the drink I was expecting at all.

That's not to say I'm not a fan of matcha. I most certainly do like the flavor, but Tea Fusion Cafe made the drink a bit too powdery. I didn't like the chalky aftertaste hanging around on my tongue. However, I did like how they used crushed ice and that the grass jelly was silky, even though the pieces all floated to the top.

I was alarmed that in terms of prices, Tea Fusion Cafe closely matched those in the Bay Area. I thought California was always going to be more expensive when compared to North Carolina, but clearly that isn't always the case. Perhaps the lack of demand raises the price?

When it comes to boba, though, I don't think there are a lot of states that can compete with the plethora of choices in California, but to see that Charlotte had at least one was a pleasant surprise. It may not have been perfect, but it was good enough for me to finish the cup with a smile.",414

That being said, the Freshii Bowl I ordered was a little heavy on the brown rice, and didn't have enough veggies or protein to be perfect.  All in all, it was good.  It tasted great.

The problems are twofold.  I was in there for half an hour to forty minutes.  During that time, there were two songs on rotation.  Two songs.  It's enough to drive you insane.  Sure they were decent indie rock tunes but man, I must have heard them each seven or eight times.

The other problem is their gift cards and their stamp cards.  The stamp cards are only good for a calendar month, so if you are lucky enough to start on the first, and eat there all the time, you might get one (maybe two if you go every other day) loyalty reward meals.  It's hardly worth carrying the card.  Their gift cards expire pretty darn fast too, like 3 months or so.  I had a fifty dollar gift card I almost lost out on.

Chef Chris is outside writing up the day's sweet & savory brunch menu.  We walk on over, and he remembers the message I had left him the day before.  He wishes Edgar a happy birthday.  He explains the way the restaurant is run and tells us to help ourselves to the beverage area as there's hibiscus tea, coffee, water w/mint leaves and orange juice.  A cute little station with beautiful drinkware.  We help ourselves and get comfy on a bench outside.  

A few minutes in, his helper comes out and tells us to take a seat anywhere we'd like and asks us what we would like to order.  We order one each of both dishes.  One savory and one sweet.  When our meals actually came out, we took one bit, and I went inside to tell Chef Chris to bring us each the opposite of what we just ordered.  We couldn't share!  It was too dang good!  DELICIOUS is an understatement!

For the sweet dish we had pumpkin french toast with roasted pear, amber maple syrup, cranberry butter and spicy chicken sausage.  For savory we had grilled porkloin w/feta, herb potatoes, fried egg and tomato sauce.  

The flavors that were extracted from these dishes are unbelievable.  Chef Chris creates a custom menu every single day, and you'll never have the same meal here.  It was divine.  The french toast is one, if not THE BEST french toast my fiance and I have ever had anywhere.  We didn't drench the french toast with syrup as there was no need for it.  The texture was spot on, and it was moist.  The cranberry butter was absolutely delicious, and it accompanied nicely to the chicken sausage.  

The porkloin was cooked PERFECTLY.  Not dry and not under done.  The herb potatoes were stacked beautifully with wonderful herbs and spices, and the very top layer was crispy.  Perfectly cooked fried eggs (it takes a real special person to make perfect eggs in my opinion), and the tomato sauce was out of this world.  This wasn't some run of the mill tomato sauce.  It was home made, thick and hearty tomato sauce.  

This was the perfect way to end our trip to Scottsdale, and we were so happy to have been able to experience Cafe Monarch.  Chef Chris is truly talented, and you can feel his passion and love for what he does.  Not a lot of Chefs carry this same passion, but he does.  There is LOVE in each and every dish - no factory style kitchen dishes coming out of here.  

My fiance said it... ""the best breakfast I've ever had.""

Thank you again Chef Chris!",578

Was introduced to this place by a friend and I think I've just added a new place to go if I ever have a hankering for Chinese noodles.  So the place is nicely located, away from the bustling streets of Bay and Dundas, so there isn't all that traffic noise and mess (on Edward Street, which is basically behind the Atrium, with St Louis Wings, Spring Rolls and that whole commercial complex).

Place is tiny, but the place, and the set up of it, suggests a quick, dine in and get out concept.  But when we got there on a Wednesday (as a table of 4), waiter was quick to get the table cleared and have us seated, and in the meantime took down our order! The efficiency at this place is brilliant! 

So the menu itself, only has....really two items, plus a series of side dishes.  Soup noodles and saucy noodles! (I'm pretty sure that's not the actual name, but that's the easiest way to log it into my head). 

Ok, even there's two noodle bowls to pick from, you can choose the thickness of the noodles, which I believe come in like 6-7 different variations, and they show it on the menu via diagrams to show the thickness of the noodles (funny enough the names of the noodle size options are in Chinese, and Romanized Chinese, so inside of saying ""wide"", they'd use the word ""kuan"".  I slightly chuckled at it lol.  Oh, mega bonus! Waiter asked me if I wanted cilantro with my soup (if you get the saucy noodles, you get a bowl of soup) and I immediately said no (hate cilantro).  So happy that he asked that, and that I had that sort of customization.

Service was super quick, given how small the place is, and the waitress was like Sonic The Hedgehog, going table to table, attentive, constantly pouring water and adhering to requests.  And not to mention, she always had a smile too, very pleasant.  

The food, so I got the saucy noodles (and the usual ""kuan"" noodles).  To describe, it's basically...a Chinese version of a Korean Bibimbap but with hand pulled noodles.  You have the minced pork, julienne carrots, julienne cucumbers and then the noodles at the bottom and you mix it all up.  Also, it came with soup too (sans cilantro).

Taste?  Super delicious, the noodles with the minced pork made for an aromatic, not overly salty taste.  It was slightly sweet but mainly savoury and then the crunchy texture of the vegatable with the soft, but not overcooked, bouncy noodles, compliment so well.  I just love when food has multiple tastes and textures.  Only gripe?  It got heavy and really oily at the bottom (that honestly could have been me who didn't fully mix).  The soup on the side was alright, wasn't all that special, but the taste was pretty light.

Overall, great place, one I'd be willing to bring other friends if I'm ever in the downtown area.",536

They weren't on break just eating while working. The kitchen floor was filthy with food all over the floor near the grill. The employees just walked through it. Must of been 8 to 10 employees working but no one can sweep up the floor? The waffle makers and area they sit in were covered in globs of waffle batter...not sure if that's normal but it looked pretty gross. I'd pretty much lost my appetite while I stared at the kitchen from my seat..food was average but I didn't eat much..that was my first and last visit to waffle house. .not for me,116

Somehow I fell out of the rhythm of these lunch stops, and it's been at least a couple of years since I checked the place out again, and I am happy to report that the burgers are as good as they used to be.  

I don't know what it is, there's certainly nothing fancy about either the food or the presentation, but somehow every burger I've ever had there is the perfect combination of soft fresh bun, crunchy lettuce, tart tomato, and a burger that is just the right proportion with a well melted slice of cheese on top. It sounds like something that shouldn't be that difficult to do, but somehow they manage to do it consistently well here.  The end product is perhaps the best burger in this part of town, seriously. 

They've also updated their menu some since my last visit, lots of new items and sandwiches clustered around the general category of bar/comfort food.  One standout from these new items is the Beef Brisket sandwich - a soft thick pile of brisket in mustard bbq sauce on a grilled pretzel roll- a seriously good sandwich.  

Eastland Inn has been around seemingly forever, and it has the well worn edges of an authentic neighborhood bar.  It's unpretentious, homey, and the food is surprisingly good.  Definitely worth your while to check it out.",270

The whole process was very smooth. The staff was very accommodating. The prices were very reasonable. My favorite part was the beautiful private room we used. It was in the corner of the restaurant housed by large barn doors. The space was colorful and very roomy. We had a very nice server who attended to our needs very well. The menu we were given was So yummy. Everyone liked their meal. They came out fresh and hot. I quite enjoyed the experience and plan on coming back. If you are hosting a party, I recommend having it at cantina 1511! My organization is a state agency and we are tax exempt and cantina 1511 worked with us very well!

I attribute that to the bike shop back in NJ. I was surprised the shop employee in Surprise didn't spot it. Also the old Bontrager basket connector that was on the bike was missing. Still waiting on a call from them as to where the connector is.
I rode the bike a couple of times and decided to take it in and have the wheel replaced. Also, the handlebars were loose. Took it to Build a Bike this time as I didn't trust the other store to treat me right. The people at Build a Bike were great. They were very knowledgeable and did the repair within a half hour. Also, the front wheel had originally been installed backward. Needless to say, we have a new bike store.",174

Seating is in the middle but large (mostly glass) dividers separate you from the stations making it feel more like a restaurant than a buffet.  As mentioned in other reviews, the dessert section was by far the highlight of the meal.

We saw a show in Rio and ate here as we wanted an upper scale place and this really was the only one still open in Rio after 10.  They did not have wine we wanted... and did not have coke products (but that seems common in Vegas).  We asked for bread twice and the second time our server Darcy told us that his assistant was incompetent.  Not cool.  Just fix it.  When the guy brought the bread it was cold... as in they took it out of the fridge cold.  We asked for warm bread and the assistant told us it takes a while as they put all the bread away for the night and have to reheat it.  Huh?  I ordered the Oyster Rockefeller which was good but not what I am used to being from Louisiana... still good though.  I also had the lobster roll which had too much mayo.  I did not finish that and my tummy was queezy after.  My 2 friends each had pasta dishes which I almost ordered but was so glad I did not.  They were supposed to be in cream sauces and it looked so watery and gross.  They took a few bites then just ate bread instead.  They brought us some grilled garlic bread but when we turned it over we saw that it was burned.  The place has an open kitchen where you can see the cooking taking place and that was a sign as everyone looked angry and unhappy.  Our bad for not leaving.  Such a waste of money.,287

Why, well because it's gorgeous and I'm a sucker for a Gondola ride (that's right ladies, I'd give it up for a Gondola ride)!! Speaking of up (well a different kind of up), the one and only complaint I have about the Venetian is that I always leave with a cramp in my neck. The ceilings are unbelievable, filled with paintings, and not to mention all of the detail that goes into the molding. But back to the Gondola ride, a quarter-mile Grand Canal flows through the hotel, past the piazzas and shops. All the mean time the rest of the crowd gets to watch you or ignore you because they are too vested in the 80 international boutiques and name brand outlet stores. Cobblestone pathways filled with street performers to entertain you, and then at the end you find yourself in a large room with painted floor to ceiling walls to give that impression of being in Venice. In here you'll find multiple restaurants and more street performers to make that dinning experience so much more enjoyable. There is nothing like the Venetian unless maybe Venice herself. 

Speaking of restaurants, the Venetian is filled with the best fine dining you can experience on the strip and equally with the shows (A Bronx Tale, Phantom, Blue Man Group, Jersey Boys, comedy acts like Wayne Brady and David Spade). It is also home of the Madame Tussaud's wax museum. The service is always top notch and the suites are memorable. 

If I could I would always stay here!",272

My dress is white with black embellishments, and I really wanted a black veil, but I hated all the thicker black ones I saw online... cheap-looking and Hot-Topic esque, I felt.

But then I found a photo on Pinterest of a bride with an incredibly thin black veil in the sheerest, most delicate tulle I've ever seen, and I adored it. I miraculously tracked it down as having been made by Cleo & Clementine, so I reached out to them and asked them about the possibility of making one for me. I actually assumed it would be way more expensive than it was, but the price (~$300 for cathedral length) was within my range. They worked with me via email to create my custom order, and it finally arrived tonight! 

My dress is also being custom made, so I don't have it yet, and therefore don't have any way of knowing how the veil with look paired with my dress. I imagine, though, that it will be perfect. It's the exact fabric I asked for, and I can't wait to see the end result. I'll definitely return to post photos after my wedding day!",213

So when Fresh City Farms sent me a $15 voucher in the mail, I was excited to try it. I like the idea of having already prepared dinners once or twice a week ready for me after a long day, so I purchased the deconstructed salmon roll and 2 butter chicken meal jars. 

1) Having to pick up the bag from a local pickup point if you don't spend a minimum of $65/week is slightly inconvenient. But, having to drop off the bags too afterwards is what really irks me. Why cant they use disposable packaging to save from 2 trips.

2) The deconstructed salmon roll jar was 60-70% brown rice, and not much else. And, when eating the salmon I encountered 2 bones. There was also a lack of flavour, I was hoping for something more like a poke bowl, and basically had some rice with a side of salmon. For the price, I could have picked something up nearby that would have been better.

3) I was really hoping that the butter chicken would be a hit for my boyfriend and I, since we love getting butter chicken as takeout. I understand this was going to be a healthier take on things. The jar looked delicious, and had a good amount of protein. However, looks can be deceiving. The sauce tasted like a poorly executed curry vs. a butter chicken. Lots of chickpea and ginger flavour, I don't think any tomato base was even used. It was very dry, and after two bites, we trashed both of our meals, and opted for some frozen meals (that LUCKILY I had stashed for a lazy day).

Maybe their grocery delivery would yield a better experience. But, based on my experience with the meal jars, I would be hesitant to try. With the abundance of health food stores and healthy meal prep delivery options in the city, I would advise to steer clear of Fresh City Farms.",342

We ordered a chicken salad, a beef taco and the beef burrito combo (combo means rice and beans, no drink) 

The chicken salad had a ton of chicken and not a lot of lettuce. The quality of the chicken was great and very flavorful. All in all, good dish. 

The beef on the taco and burrito needed some seasoning. It was kind of bland. The portions of all the dishes were very good. The taco was the size of a Taco Bell taco, but was $2. 

I saw the meats go on the grill raw which made me happy. It wasn't sitting there all day! 

It was $13 for the 3 items so that's not too bad considering the portions. We will try different dishes, but so far it wasn't anything ""out of this world"". It's nice they have a drive thru and it's open 24 hours.

Its overall a nice place especially since it's in a small Asian strip mall where there is a nice grocery store I can buy food at, a nice food court for some Asian food and a lovely 99 cent or more store for some materials for class. When I'm too lazy to go to pmall this is an okay second option, so I'm very happy there is a western store here despite being slightly old.",227

This is a small chain from Texas and the food is good, if atypical, Southwestern style Mexican food. Los Cucos can't compete with Vegas local powerhouse Lindo Michoacan, but it still has pretty good eats and great service. 

The interior is strange, a rag-tag looking atmosphere in what is (obviously) a space formerly inhabited by MiMi's Cafe. The Mardi Gras balcony is still there, but now there's some sparse, randomly placed Mexican decor lining the walls. The restaurant feels spacious, open and clean, and there's a particularly nice open bar area right inside the front door. The place lacks character, but it's a pleasant enough atmosphere. 

I had to laugh at the menu because it's loaded with misspellings (""crispi"" tacos, ""romain"" lettuce) and some of the descriptions are exactly the same for different items (check out the special fajitas on the menu). When I pointed this out to our server, she couldn't explain it nor tell me which item it was that was the correct description. I eventually got what I wanted, but the menu had the dish listed under two different names. You'd think for a chain restaurant, the menu would be consistent (and free of spelling errors). 

As with most Mexican eateries, the house serves complimentary chips and salsa. The chips were good enough but served cold; the salsas are DELICIOUS. Like seriously delicious. There's a spicy, smoky red salsa that's served warm and a fantastic avocado crema style cold salsa. Both of these were the highlight of my meal and I am still craving them (they'll make me return to the restaurant often). 

We ordered the queso with shrimp as an appetizer. At $11.95, it's overpriced. The cheese wasn't that warm when it was served and the queso was loaded with red onions, mushrooms and other unnecessary stuff. The shrimp was seasoned well and quite delicious; however, I wouldn't order this again. 

For lunch I ordered chicken fajitas and my husband ordered steak fajitas. The meat quality was top-notch. I LOVED the marinade on both of the meats, and we both agreed the meat was some of the best in town. The fajita vegetables were just okay -- onions and poblano peppers. I was disappointed in the overall fajitas, but I'd love to have just the meat served on its own. I had fajitas that came ""loaded"" with bacon and cheese, and it was an unusual and very tasty combo. The side plate was huge and had so/so beans, average rice, and very tasty guacamole and pico de gallo. 

Fatty alert: they serve homemade flour tortillas, and they are delicious! I love Mexican restaurants that care enough to make legit tortillas, and I'm happy that Los Cucos does it right. I could've eaten two dozen of them! It's a bummer that they aren't served in tortilla warmers to keep them soft but instead are plopped on the table sandwiched between paper towels. This means the tortillas get hard very quickly. Best to gobble them up as soon as possible!

After our lunch, Jesus the manager came over to ask how we enjoyed everything. He was very eager to please and happy to listen to our suggestions. I was very impressed with this personal touch and the efficient, friendly service we received. 

This isn't the best Mexican food in Vegas, but the kitchen uses very high quality ingredients, the prices on most menu items are fair, and the service is good. This is a great place to add to the dining rotation, especially if you live near Mountain's Edge and the Arroyo.",626

We were so excited to come here because we love Blaze but don't have one on this side of town. To begin, the first person to help, Richard (I'm assuming a manager because of the collared shirt) asked me a question and didn't even listen to my answer. He was too busy panicking because the line got a little longer and was trying to keep his employees later. Why this was my problem, I don't know. I had to repeat myself twice because he wasn't paying attention. He pushes my food down to the next person, Kenny (also assumedly a manager, due to the collared shirt) who I had to repeat myself to several times as well because he was focused on the people walking in and talking to the employees around him to pay attention to the customer in front of him. My pizza looks like a mess as he throws the toppings all over the place. After he finishes my pizza, he goes to get a paprt towel to wipe his sweaty face... with his gloves still on! (Later we observe him wiping his nose with the edge of his glove-gross! And then pull up his pants with gloves and goes right back to putting toppings on pizza- that's just disgusting!) He then slides it down to the next person, didn't catch his name, but this one also socializing and ignoring me, I'm waiting for him to ask me what veggies I would like but he's doing everything else but helping me. Again, I'm repeating myself and I get moved along to the cashier who was perfectly fine and polite. We go to sit (at a dirty table, which I cleaned myself) and get called for our pizza shortly after. It's warm-ish. Not hot, yet a little burnt on one edge... ironic. The flavors are good. Love the spicy pepperoni and beef meatball crumble. Everything else is the same as Blaze and Pieology. A floor/bus person, Micah, checks on us, which is nice, but obviously hasn't been trained on how to clean. He wipes a table next to us with a napkin and flicks an olive off the table. All in all, the customer service was ridiculous. I work in the food industry and would never allow my employees to behave this way. If these guys are the managers, they are leading by a terrible example. We may come back in hopes that today was just a bad day, but I am just so disappointed. I would rather make the trip to go to Blaze in Henderson than come to this place down the street. Please tighten up your staff and customer service. Until then, I definitely would not recommend this place to anyone.",459

Kinda pricey and easily overpriced. I will not be back. I'd rather go to Luxor and Excalibur all day for 15 bucks more. I'm glad this was a business trip and was expensed. Here's the breakdown of why:
-The ""steak"" was rediculously overdone, which I can see why they would drown it in sauce.
-The Roast Beef at the carving station looked more like a ball of muscle that they literally just lopped off of a cow. ""Yeah hey, lets not trim that, it looks fine... I mean sure it looks like the meatball alien thing from Duke Nukem, but people love nostalgia.
-The macaroni and cheese was creamy, but only tasted like macaroni. Why would you serve this?
-The Crab legs... are sliced through with, what I would assume was, a table saw. Nothing screams delicious like small bits of crab leg shell in the steamed-out, dried up, blade-o-grass thin, crab legs.
After I had essentially given up on the ""great eating"" here, I decided to try the lower quality ""food"". Who the hell makes sweet and sour chicken with chicken nuggets? Oh these guys do. And the nuggets? The only thing they were missing was a Double Bubble Branding.
I didn't want to delve into why whys and hows, because it wasn't going to be pretty, but here it is. I hope that MGM can rise from this mess and actually produce decent food again soon.",245

Decent prices + me being able to sit down and have decently executed cuisine from 4 different asiatic countries for dinner = awesome.

The lunch menu is limited but still very veg friendly. Dinner is where its at. I love malaysian curry (well, curry of any kind, really) and the Curry Vegetable Chef's special hits the spot. Okra and eggplant, tomato, tofu, green beans, yes yes. Oily, smokey curry and delicious coconut milk, yumm. Unless you're ravenous, the 11$ will be well spent, as you'll have lunch for the next day. And we all know curries improve overnight ;) They have both Thom Kha and Hot n Sour veg options, both soups I adore. Tofu can be added/subbed to almost anything here.

All the sushi I've had has been perfectly prepared, with good ingredients. The rolls aren't 80% rice, 20% stuff. They're also flexible about ingredients, something a lot of places are not (have them make you a vegetable tempura roll - delicious).

I wish they had coconut rice, and gado gado. I don't get the ""shrimp sauce"" served with the hibachi items (a mixture of what tasted like mayo and ketchup, yikes). For my malaysian curry fix, however... I'm stoked they're here.",250

I have yet to acquire a taste for raw oysters, but I have to say it's not bad at all! This was only my second time ever eating a raw oyster, and even though I had a tiny bit of shell in my bite (this ALWAYS happens to me, I have such horrible luck!), it was enough to make me want to stay longer and try more of P. J. Clarke's food. My boyfriend loved the oysters he had and wishes we had more time to hang out there and order more. We ate our oysters at the bar, and our bartender was extremely friendly and gregarious. His happy-go-lucky attitude definitely rubbed off on everyone seated at the bar. He also whipped up my boyfriend's special request of drink--sprite & mint leaves, aka nonalcoholic mojito. 

Overall, I'd say if you're looking to kill some time, grab a quick/cheap bite, and enjoy good company, come down to P.J. Clarke's for happy hour!",226

Bottom line stayed the same.  As we are leaving, we questioned the sales price being $2000 more than sticker price and sales man retrieved paper from floor of car that had price $3000 more than sticker.

This is the best of a trio of Ethiopian restaurants within about 1000 yards of each other. The other two are (1) Lali-Bela is one street north and (2) Axum (across the street). A fourth restaurant named Meskerem is in front of the convention center.

MANNERS
Eat with only your right hand. Very important! 

BEST ENTREE
I had the Kitfo ""Ethiopian version of steak tartar, raw red chopped beef"" ($8)  and an Ethiopian beer for $3.50 and sat at the bar. For $8 you couldn't finish the food and it is very tasty. Take a chance on the raw meat! If you are scared stick with lamb tibs.

SERVICE
Very friendly people, nice service, excellent cuisine and rock bottom prices. Waitresses are very attractive.  They speak in a very quiet vernacular of British-African English which can be difficult to hear.

DIRECTIONS
The strip mall is pretty seedy , and half the stores are empty. 

BUS: route #203 you catch on the Palazzo side under the overpass to the Wynn. Your 24 hour Deuce pass is also good for 24 hours on local buses. Try to be there on the half hour interval 15 minutes before or 15 minutes past the hour.

DRIVE: Less than 2 miles from this intersection, plenty of parking

WALK: Questionable at night, OK in the day. It is a half mile from the southern back entrance to the convention center. Head south on Swensen and make a left at the 7-11.
   If you walk between the Venetian and the Wynn you will follow the monorail route until you get to Paradise Ave. After you cross Paradise, Sands Avenue turns into Twain avenue and you begin passing McDonald's, gas stations and Latino themed strip malls, and apartments. The restaurant is about 1000 yards past Paradise Ave after you cross Swenson . There is a 7-11 on the end of the strip mall. The windows of Merkato are very dark, but it's near the corner of the L shaped building.",347

Poor choice in closing the extra room after all these years.

It isn't the fanciest of equipment, but it gets the job done.  Its the nearest gym facility in the Southwest area, so it is a pretty busy gym.  I've been here early AM and late PM, and yup, still fairly busy.  The gym etiquette here is good.   Meaning, for the most part, people re-rack the weights, will ask if your done with the equipment, etc.  That's almost hard to come by.

Though I said small, it actually is rather large when you walk in. The place is clean and reminds me a lot of Sushi Kiku. The lunch menu is $13.99 and I found myself a bit disappointed by the options.

The sushi was decent enough. The salmon and surf clam sushi were pretty good and I found the rolls to be pretty decent as well. The spicy crab roll and the hand rolls were done very well and they definitely have more meat than rice in this place. The hot foods like udon and skewers were subpar. Smaller portions (which is OK for AYCE), but quality wasn't there either.

Most of my AYCE favorites like seaweed salad and shrimp sushi can only be found for dinner, which is disappointing. The place is OK but being that its the same price as almost every AYCE sushi spot, there is nothing to really differentiate this place from others.",169

Then, I would get distracted by someone wanting to race down Jefferson, after my keys were handed to me, which happened to be the only exciting thing that woke me up out of my stupor from the yawner games.

That was last season. I haven't been back to watch a Suns game since. However, I finally made it to Arrogant Butcher for dinner with my Beloved wife.

This is now, to me, one of the bright spots on Jefferson street, in Downtown Phoenix!

We came here on a Saturday afternoon, and were introduced to the subdued elegance that is the interior of this establishment. The layout is open, inviting, and bustling with a fair amount of patrons.

The hostesses, servers, and bussers were cordial, attentive, polite and efficient.

I had chose the Prime Rib Au Jus with Mashed Potatoes. Although the mashed potatoes weren't particularly spectacular, the slow roasted Prime Rib had a wonderfully succulent texture. Additionally, it was well seasoned and delectable.. Each bite was just scrumptious.

About the only downside of my meal selection was the asparagus. It seemed to have been overdone, then chilled which took away most of the recognizable flavors that is inherent in this particular vegetable.

My wife had the Green Chile Stew. That too was a big hit, and the addition of a fried egg on top made for a particularly appetizing and visually appealing meal. She indicated that it was more Chili, than Stew. But, that did not detract from her overall positive comments and impression of her meal selection.

The Salmon Rillette was also particularly notable as a spread on the wonderfully prepared and grilled bread. Simply savory!",312

Some of the highlights I had were the already pealed shrimp, prime rib and some of the pasta's. Some of the low lights, the Chinese food, the sushi and the desserts. Chinese food was crap, the sushi was sub par although there was a large selection. The dessert stations looked nice but the food itself wasn't good. And now for the BIGGEST low light. The crab legs. I had some high expectations for them, including love when i saw that they were already cracked open and all you needed was your fork so that you could just remove the meat and eat. The problem....they were frozen solid. I took two legs and let them rest a few mins figuring they would thaw out and be ok...they were too far gone frozen. Honestly just crappy. I was very disappointed with the whole thing especially for the place and the price.",184

Sort of a cool neighborhood bar with a small bar food menu.  Most of the patrons seemed to know each other or were in small groups at a single table like we were.  I counted 7 screens but I forgot to see if there were any over by the pool tables.  4 pool tables, 7 dart boards, shuffleboard and a couple of video games.  The tables and stools are all anchored.  The door has been replaced with a privacy wall in the men's room and the one stall looks like the door has been removed and replaced a few times.  The padded rails on the tables need reupholstering.  Overall the place seems in pretty good shape.  They have a fenced in smoking patio but I didn't see any chairs or tables on it.

I had a toasted ham and cheese on sourdough ($5.75)and I chose to have it with onion rings, although I could have chosen fries or cottage cheese.  It was good and I thought a pretty good deal.  I had MGD long necks at $3 each.  Not sure if that was happy hour or regular price, I didn't ask.  

All the employees I dealt with were pleasant and efficient.  I Left by 7 so I don't know if the vibe changes as the evening goes on.  I noticed several folks just like me that joined friends and left after a drink or two.  I had a good time with friends and wouldn't hesitate to go back again.

The woman opening up early Saturday sure looked at me funny taking pictures of the place as she walked up to the door. :-)",314

Arriving at around 6:10pm on a Tuesday, they were almost full. Parking lot had ample amount of space to accommodate, as they are located on the outer part of Town Square in the Northeast corner (of Sunset Rd and Las Vegas Blvd). 
Love the rustic look, and it works well because of how clean they keep it! Greeted upon arrival to the front desk area, despite how busy they were we were seated right away! 
The hostess was polite and the server came shortly to take our drink order and answer any questions. Cheryl gets more than an amazing rating and deserves a raise. She goes beyond mediocrely doing your minimum job duties. And with a smile and laugh! She was prompt to return with our drinks and take our order. 
Our appetizers came out quickly by different and polite runners. When our main courses arrived, another different and angry looking runner plopped our plates down and left my plate hanging almost half off the table towards me and left quickly without taking the empty plate out of the way. It was hanging over because of the lack of room! We let Cheryl know how rude and lazy that was of her, so she apologized for that and let her manager on duty know. 
When Tony came around to us, he asked me if everything was alright with my food, as I had only eaten less than half (I ordered the bison). I informed him that it was spectacular (as was my moms rack of ribs) and I was just full. Then proceeded to tell him about the runner that treated this just like another paycheck without a care for the reputation of the company. His showing of genuine concern put us at ease because he understood that's not what keeps people coming back and paying their bills. Not only did he apologize for the runners behavior, he also offered to buy us a dessert (which we tried to refuse). He and Cheryl are completely what any company wants to see representing their name by building great rapport with their customers. 
One person won't ruin this review, as the rest of whom we dealt with were equally as pleasant, without as much direct contact. My mom and I thank you, for making this experience one we won't forget and we'll be coming back for more!! Everything I've tasted so far has been so delicious, no matter what I'm in the mood for - so many choices! Prices are worth the taste and service offered!",451

I was looking forward to good food as well as saying hi to the owner, unfortunately she was very busy helping out in the kitchen when I got there. This place is a whole lot busier than the first few months when it was opened. Still clean. Still spacious. Everything is exactly the way I remember it. 

Service: Service is still great. Even after the bill was paid, they still come by to check up on us and even offered to give us to go cup for more sodas. We politely turned it down but thought it was very nice. 

Food: I ordered a Thai basil dish with beef and it wasn't as good as Basil fried rice. Beef doesn't have much flavor on it and I can hardly taste the basil flavor. We also ordered egg rolls and it was pretty decent. 

Rating: Overall I still think it is a good Thai restaurant. I'll come back here again to try some other different dishes.",187

I came here while visiting Montreal with my husband and my parents. We heard they have the best, most well-known and authentic Montreal bagels. We came for a late breakfast, almost at lunch time. We waited for a long time for a table, which was fine & expected. When we sat, our server forgot to take our order. In the mean time, she was taking all of the orders at the other tables around us. We were confused as we hadn't been rude or done anything except stand and wait for our table. We were waving our hands, politely, to try to get her attention because we thought maybe she had forgotten about us as the restaurant was super busy. After about 30 minutes of waiting for her to take our order, she finally came over. She didn't apologize. We put in our drink orders first, and when she returned, she forgot some of our drinks. Normally this would be totally fine for us, but since we had already waited so long, we were getting impatient (And hungry). When she finally got us the correct drinks, we asked for some milk for our coffees, and she never ended up bringing it till the end when our drinks were finished. For our meals, we all ordered different bagel sandwiches. They were decent, nothing special, nothing to rave about. We are from New York State, so we can get amazing bagels close to home. Maybe our expectations for bagels are just high because we're New Yorkers. If you're in Montreal and want to try the bagels here for yourself, I'd say give it a go. You might be impressed, but we were not. I think the lower rating has something to do with the service and treatment, but it definitely isn't 4-5 star food in my opinion. We don't expect American service when we go abroad as we realize the standards and culture are different, but after being in various restaurants in Montreal, this was the only place where we had a problem with the service.",367

I went with my mom and boyfriend and we booked over the phone. I loved it and they were so accommodating. I couldn't wait to stay there again.
Fast forward a year and a half...my mother in law asked us to join her and her family in Vegas. She offered to buy us a room at Planet Hollywood so we could be near her. We declined since we wanted to stay at our favorite hotel. We made the reservation online and thankfully I took a screenshot on my laptop of the confirmation.
We drive ten hours and call ahead of time to make sure our room is still ready since we weren't going to arrive until 3am. I opened the reservation in my email and called the number on it. The woman I talked to said she found my reservation and then asked my name again and said she couldn't find it. She asked for the confirmation number and when I tried to reopen the email, it was gone. Of course, the screenshot I took was on a laptop we did not bring with us and our phone call got disconnected. When we arrived, we were exhausted and wanting to just check in and head to bed, but instead we were told there was no reservation, that the computers were having issues and they had no more rooms available. We almost left, but I really wanted to stay in this hotel. I asked if they had rooms available tomorrow and made a reservation with $25 early check in. We also paid cash to make sure our reservation wasn't lost again.
We had to wander around Vegas and sleep in our hot car until my mom in law woke up to let us in her hotel room. Once we were able to check in, I showed the woman at the desk the confirmation page our friend sent us from our laptop. She waived our resort tax fee. Our room was okay, but not as good as the first time I stayed. It had a weird smell and the faucet sprayed water everywhere when turned on. For the price, we were happy.
That night I decided we were going to stay another, so I went to extend it. They tried to run my card and I was told it was declined even though I had more than enough to cover it. She promised that they wouldn't give up my room and that they could do it tomorrow for me. My dude decided to go ahead and pay in cash again and extended our trip. I went again the next morning and she told me were were paid off until Sunday and actually had a $46 credit on our account.
We stayed until Saturday and bought drinks with our credit. We checked out a day early and upon checkout they said we still owed $126 and had no record of our paying cash the second time. We used our card and decided not to argue more with them since they did not know who worked the day before and could not verify what we had been told. We were pissed that we were being told different things each time we went to the desk and each time we had to speak to a different person. The constant change of shifts, computer and money errors and overall chaos and disorganization ruined this hotel for me. Hopefully, if we ever decide to stay there again, they will be more accommodating and under better management. It sucks that my favorite hotel that I recommended to everyone turned into a nightmare.",617

This location is closer to King and Spadina and may be a bit hard to find since it is on a small road. They only have about four tables, however, the location wasn't too busy so I was able to secure a table no problem.

I order their matcha crepe cake ($7.74) and it was so good! It is a bit pricey, however, it is a labour intensive process to make the cake. The cake had a thin layer of matcha on top so the bitterness of the matcha really help balance the sweetness. 

They also offer tarts, gelatos and cream puffs so I'll have to come back and give these a try!",132

First impression: It was much bigger than I expected!  Keep in mind that I only just found out that they underwent expansion a few years back.  Still, I was pleasantly surprised!

On another note, I really liked the branded Snakes & Lattes shirts the employees wore.

When we headed to the games wall at the back, we were greeted by a friendly employee who offered his help and kindly grabbed us Uno to go with the other games we chose.

When we returned to our table, we were greeted by a server and I ordered a Nutella latte ($5).  It arrived in a large cup with saucer and had some fancy latte art on top!  I think that this is the third Nutella latte I've had in the city and by far, it has been the best.  I can actually taste the Nutella (although not that much but I have kind of a sweet tooth anyway).  Not to mention, the rest of the beverage itself was nice and smooth.  For $5, I also think that the size of the drink makes it an excellent value.  I would recommend, however, that they include a small spoon so you can eat the Nutella ""dregs"" at the bottom once you've finished!

Decent drinks and okay desserts. Very difficult to find the place but the best description I can give is to look for the office building with greenish tinted windows that has ""100 York""  labeled on the building.

The atmosphere is more targeting teens and the younger crowed with menus that look more like a child's story book. Its weird see men in suit and tie holding what looks like a child's menu. If I was opening a cafe in this area I would probably be targeting the many office workers in the area. But I guess it gets most of its business from the younger crowed during the night since its been around for so long.

Large Macchiatto $6 - WARNING - wait for it to cool down or sip very slowly or else you might get burned like I did. The drink is topped with cool whip cream so when the scolding hot drink hits your lips its a painful surprise. The drink itself is sweet and pretty good.

Large Cappuccino $5 - lots of foam on top, pretty decent flavour.

Also got a slice of cake called the Cherry Potter for $8.50 - probably the most expensive slice of cake I have ever purchased. Fell way short of expectations. It was basically a New York cheese cake with apple crumble and cherries. The syrup sauce from the cherries were over powering and really didn't taste really good and ruined the cheese cake itself. Most expensive and one of the worst cheese cakes I have ever had.

Service was good as there wasn't really that many customers at about 2:30pm.",289

I got onion soup and the grilled cheese with bacon and the power slaw. My husband got the cheese balls and the French dip with fries.  Overall comment on the food?  Layers of flavor!  Super rare at restaurants. Power slaw is coleslaw with kale and other healthy veggies thrown in.  Fries are fresh cut and delicious.  Cheese balls are fresh made.

Eat Mexican!! LOL!

The review Patty left is crazy because I had the complete opposite encounter. We went in around 1:30 and there are only two ladies working, the cook and the server. She told us hello and to sit wherever we wanted. We sat and she came up and spoke to us in a friendly manner, we order WATER, HORCHATA, and some Mexican cokes. A few minutes later she came out with all of our drinks and took our order. I ordered a carne asada gordita, sans beans, and some fries and my BF orders a Cali burrito.

Now, Yelp guidelines are pretty... flexible, I never cuss in my reviews, but an email I received said they like for the reviewers to express their passion, so, I'm going to do just that.

THE CARNE ASADA IS MOTHERFUCKING AMAZING. IT'S THE BEST FUCKING CARNE ASADA to come out of a little shop. It's HELLA FUCKING better than Tacos el Gordo, and any other carne asada out of a small resto just blows dicks compared to this one! And guess what? You want fucking taco Tuesday? or like us beaners, taco any day? Come here! Tacos are 1.35$, wait bitch, did you just say $1.35?? For a fucking street taco?! YAAAASSS BITCH! Come get some delicious, juicy meat, in a small tortilla and put that shit down your throat, just like some other meat, you booches! 

Anyway, out food was super delicious, and priced oh so right. You definitely get your fill. Burritos are huge just like my boyfriends... dimples. And the gordita is just like me, juicy and delicious. One will def do! The free chips and beans are a nice touch!

This isn't some opulent resto, this is a mom and pop owned hole in the wall. Don't expect a cloth napkin and them to lick your ass. Support them!

Also, Patty, I didn't see any self serve water areas... stay off that yayo, girl! LOL

Yay!",338

The pizza can't be beat, the service from the family members themselves is hospitable (other staff members just seem to be unsure of themselves). They were too kind when they learned we had just moved to the neighbourhood and it was our first time. They gave us a fair price on our two HUGE XL pizzas. When one of the pizzas came out with pepperoni instead of peppers (a miscommunication on their end), they said they'd take care of us next time we came in. A couple days later I returned to buy a falafel and though another staff member was helping me originally, the owner stepped in and took care of wrapping it herself and not charging me. I felt bad - this is how much value there food has - I felt like I received SO MUCH and gave them SO LITTLE. She refused my money so I put it in the tip jar. TIPS FOR CHITO'S AND BEWARE: advertises free delivery but they no longer do it and am guessing they don't care enough/have the money to spend on printing new flyers and signage. Whatever, they put out an AMAZING pizza, will totally let this slide. The garlic sauce is awesome, ask for extra on the side. And lastly: stick to the pizza. Everything else is super mediocre (but cheap!). LASTLY for real this time, be sure to get a shawarma pizza. Ask for: green peppers, spicy onions & chicken (they are very generous with the amount and put Pizza Pizza to utter shame). #TwoEntrepreneursApproved",271

Who am I kidding I've been dying literally dying to try EggSlut since before I even knew we were getting one here in Vegas and somehow my dreams came true. 

Conveniently located inside of the Cosmopolitan, EggSlut has found it's home and in opinion there is no other better place for it to be then there. Ok with much anticipations I came before a concert with a hunger and a mission. With the Slut in mind I didn't realized that they run out in the mornings with those. So we ordered the sausage, egg and cheese and the burger sandwiches. To soon I got the cold brew which was amazing I added cream and sugar. 

The prices were a bit step but to my surprise the sandwiches were actually quit big. They both came on their signature Brioche buns that was warm and toasty, slightly buttery and very good. The chicken Sausage was juicy and yummy. Topped with cheddar cheese and the runniest egg and a little bit if aoli or some sort of mayo it was the perfect sandwich. The burger was delish with a super juicy patty and sweet pickles to break up all the savory. It was a tasty surprise. 

All in all it was good, filling and you gotta love the branding. I will probably come back for the ""Slut"" which I didn't get to try but I don't know if I can pay the price on a daily. $30 something for 2 breakfast sandwiches and a ice coffee is pretty hefty for my budget. Regardless I'm a fan and I would definitely tell people that's it's worth it.",302

Aside from skewers they also have a variety of bbqed seafood, veggies, rice, soups and mini build your own hot pots. The skewers are the reason I go to this place as they're so flavorful and juicy, however do prepare to down 2-3 bottles of water as I'm certain MSG is blended into the seasoning (however bottled water here is complimentary which is a nice touch). Drinks are also self served where you grab what you'd like to drink from the bar fridge and bring it to your table, which will then be totaled onto your bill in the end.

We started with the caprese  bruschetta, and the ricotta cheese balls with a balsamic reduction can u say explosion of flavor in your mouth.. I had the cowboy ribeye so tender and so much flavor .... my sister had the chicken marsala she couldn't stop taking about how great it was (I stole a bit of hers and it was fantastic) .... the hubby had the shrimp pasta and it was also wonderful ...... highly recommend this restaurant !!!",103

I told the owner that my chicken still is pink and his reaction was priceless. He told me people like their chicken undercooked here and I told him the the other food seemed cold he actually started eating food from my plate with his hands. Telling me that my food isn't cold. My wife couldn't believe her eyes and either could I. My wife did like her food but the owner acted like a small child.,98

We met up with them at Free Range Brewery one night. Ordered the brewery special ($10). It came with your choice of bowl and 3 dumplings. The dumplings were disappointing. They were cooked to a nice crisp on the outside but veggie filling did not have an appealing texture. The sauce that they used didn't really work for me either. The spicy mayo made it very heavy. A lighter dumpling wrapper and a more savory dipping sauce would grealty improve the dumplings.

We opted for the spicy pork bowl. The idea intrigued me but the actual execution was a let down. Being Korean, I was expecting the awesome depth of flavors that come from good spicy pork. The flavor was barely there. The bowl had an interesting combination of ingredients but I don't know that it really worked. There were also only 3 very small pieces daikon (pickled radish). A little more would have been nice for some more texture. A larger serving container would have also been nice. It was hard to get to the ingredients buried in the bottom without kicking the things on top out on to the table. 

Overall, I'd be willing to give them another shot but they'll have to improve a few things before I'll return.",221
