Dice Game CPU:

The objective of this project was to create an AI which could play a dice game. The
rules of the game are simple: Players take turns rolling dice until they reach 100 total
points. On a player's turn, she can roll as many dice as possible until a 1 is rolled. 
After each roll, a player can choose to add the sum of their rolls to their total score,
or continue rolling as desired. Once a 1 is rolled, the player adds 1 to their total score
and their turn ends.
